Yugi: Hey, Joey! Earth to Joey!.
Yugi: Hey, are you in there? It's your turn!.
Joey: Hmmm....
Tristan: Aww, isn't he cute when he's thinking!.
Joey: He-hey, Tristan. Yugi here's teachin' me how to play Duel Monsters..
Tristan: 'Drooling Monsters'?.
Joey: *Duel* Monsters, ya nimrod!.
Tristan: Sheesh!.
Téa: They've been at it for hours. Joey's starting to get the hang of the game, but Yugi's like an expert!.
Joey: Okay, Yugi, it's time to duel!.
Kagemusha of the Blue Flame 800/400/L2/earth.
Téa: See, each card has an attack number and a defense number. First player to eliminate their opponent's 'life points' wins the duel. .
Joey: Pretty good move, *huh*, Yugi?.
Yugi: Yup, pret-ty good move, but not, good e-nough!.
Blackland Fire Dragon 1500/800/L4/dark.
Joey: What?! Thanks a lot-- a card that powerful totally wipes me out!.
Tristan: Whoa, you *stink* at this game, Joey!.
Yugi: Ahh, you did *fine*, Joey. I just have *better cards*. See, my grandpa owns a game shop, and I get all my best cards from him..
Joey: You're own game shop? What're we waitin' for? Let's go!.
Yugi (laugh): Okay. Maybe I can even get my grandpa to show us this super-rare card he's got!.
Kaiba (think): 'Rare card'? Could they have found the card that I've been searching for?!.
Yugi (calls): Grandpa? I'm home!.
Grandpa (laugh): And I see you've brought company! .
Yugi: Gramps, could you show my friends your awesome, super-rare card? .
Grandpa (comically surprised): Rare card! My *special* card? Hmmm....
Yugi: Please, please!.
Joey: *Pretty* please?.
Grandpa: Hmm... ha ha! How can I refuse? You kids are in for a treat; I don't take this card out too often. .
(As he speaks, grandpa pulls a small wooden box from behind the counter. It contains a single Duel Monsters card, with a picture of a mighty silver-blue dragon) .
Grandpa: Ready? Here it is-- the Blue-Eyes White Dragon, so rare, so powerful, I never let it leave my hands! .
Joey: A-a-awesome!.
Téa: Cool..
Tristan: Hmm, doesn't look all that special to *me*. .
Grandpa: Ahh! This card- is priceless!! There's only four of them in all the world!.
Joey: Speakin' a' priceless, I'm ready to trade!.
Grandpa: Not for *this* card!!.
Joey: Huh? Nah, I didn't mean *that* card. I meant show me some *other* cool cards to get me started. .
Grandpa: Hello, can I help you?.
Kaiba: If you *can't*, it certainly wouldn't surprise me. .
Yugi: Seto Kaiba?.
Joey: Kaiba?! .
Tristan: Doesn't he have a big fancy company to run? What's he doing down *here*?.
Kaiba: Not that it's any of your business, but I came to see the card. .
Joey: Hey, are you into Duel Monsters too? This is perfect; maybe we could all duel together sometime..
Kaiba: *Me*, duel *you*? I would have more of a challenge playing Solitaire..
Joey: What?.
Kaiba: *I* am the number-one-ranked duelist in the country and the favorite to win the Duel Monsters championship. Heh, you wouldn't last *two minutes* in a duel against me. .
Joey: Ooh, I'm shakin'! Maybe you'd like to settle this with *fists* instead a' *cards*! .
Yugi: Whoa, take it easy, Joey!.
Joey: But Yugi, Kaiba's askin' for it....
Kaiba: Now, does this shop have any worthwhile cards or not?.
Kaiba: Can it be, the Blue-Eyes White Dragon, in a dump like this?! (think) It is!! The card I've been searching for!!.
Grandpa: Well, enough window-shopping. Is there anything else I can help you with?.
(Kaiba recovers quickly, and is not happy. He lifts his briefcase and slams it on the counter, thoroughly shocking Grandpa.  Kaiba opens it and flips it around, and Grandpa oohs and ahhs at the sight of what's in the briefcase.) .
Kaiba: Listen to me, old man. Gimme your Blue-Eyes White Dragon card and I'll trade you all of these!.
Yugi, Joey, Tristan, and Téa: Whoa!!.
Grandpa: Ah, nice. But no thanks..
Yugi, Joey, Tristan, and Téa: Huh?!.
Kaiba: Ugh, fine. If you won't trade, maybe you'll *sell* it. Name your price; I can pay *anything* you ask..
Grandpa: I'm sure you could. But this card is worth more to me than you could ever offer, not because of its power, or because it's so rare, but because of what it means to me. This card was given to me by a dear friend; and so I treasure this card as I do that friend. So parting with it is completely out of the question!.
Kaiba (think): NO!!!.
Yugi: You'd feel the same even if it were a common card, right, Grandpa?.
Grandpa: Exactly. You see, this precious card has bonded with my heart. .
Kaiba: Fine! (turns to leave) I've heard enough of your nonsense! (storms out) Senile old fool!.
Kaiba (think): Heart in the cards-- ridiculous!! These cards're all about power-- and one way or another, his Blue-Eyes White Dragon card... will be mine!.
Kaiba: Gentlemen, there's a little something I'd like you to pick up for me at the game shop. .
- *Gladly*, Master Kaiba!.
Grandpa: Good mornin'. .
- My master Seto Kaiba challenges you to a duel. You will come with us now..
Grandpa: And if I were... *to decline*?.
- I'm afraid I must... *insist*..
Grandpa (think): Young Kaiba doesn't understand-- but I'll teach *him* a lesson about the Heart of the Cards!.
Joey: Man, I hope he has some cool cards today!.
Yugi: Me, too!.
Tristan and Téa: Yeah!.
Joey: Okay, gramps, I'm back to get more cards! Hey! Hey, gramps!.
Yugi: Grandpa, I'm home!.
Téa: Maybe he... went out..
Joey: *Maybe*, but why would he leave the door unlocked?.
Yugi: Hello. Game shop..
Kaiba (via phone): Ah, Yugi. Perfect..
Yugi: Kaiba?!.
Kaiba: Your grandfather's here visiting, but he's not feeling well. Why don't you come by my office and pick him up?.
Yugi: Kaiba?! What've you done, Kaiba?!.
Yugi: Grandpa!! Grandpa, a-are you okay?.
Grandpa: Yugi, I failed. I wanted to teach that boy Kaiba a lesson about the Heart of the Cards, but I lost. Ugh....
Yugi: Grandpa...!.
Kaiba: How's the old man feeling, hm?.
Joey: Kaiba! You sleaze! What've you done to him!!.
Kaiba: We had a duel, that's all, with each of us putting up our most valuable card as the prize. But I guess playing against a champion like myself was just too much  *stimulation* for the old fool..
Téa: Kaiba! You should be ashamed of yourself!.
Kaiba: It was fair. And look at the sweet prize I won..
Yugi: Grandpa's most treasured card!.
Kaiba: Yes, the Blue-Eyes White Dragon *is* a rare and powerful card. And *this* one will never be used against me. .
Grandpa: Ah! My Blue-Eyes White Dragon! M-my treasure!.
Yugi: Grandpa, hold on. (to Kaiba) How could you do such a thing!.
Grandpa: Yugi, here! Take this!.
Yugi: Huh? Grandpa...!.
Grandpa: I built this deck; I put my soul in these cards! And I taught you everything I know, Yugi. Take them! Take my cards and teach him respect! Teach Kaiba respect for the Heart of the Cards, Yugi! .
Yugi: But grandpa, you need help, I've got to get you to a doctor--.
Kaiba: Sounds like an excuse. Your friends can care for your grandfather, while you and I duel. Unless you're afraid...?.
Joey: Take 'im, Yugi! .
Joey: We can take care a' your grandpa while you take care of *creepy Kaiba*! Teach that rich, spoiled brat what a real duel's all about!.
Téa: For your grandpa, Yugi!.
Yugi: I don't know....
Joey: *Trust* me; you're, like, the best player I've ever seen, *and* you've got the Millennium Puzzle! You can do this, Yugi! I *know* ya can!.
Téa: We *all* do..
Yugi: Okay, grandpa. I'll do it..
Grandpa: I know you will, my boy. .
Téa: Everyone, put your hands together, and I'll mark us with a special sign..
All three boys: Huh?.
Joey: What gives, Téa?.
Téa: It's a symbol of our friendship, so when Yugi's dueling, no matter how tough it gets, he'll know that he's not alone-- we're all right there with him! .
Téa: Joey, Tristan and I will take Yugi's grandpa to the hospital. Why don't you get back in there and cheer Yugi on!.
Joey: Okay! Take good care of 'im, Téa!.
Kaiba: I designed this virtual stadium myself. Impressive, mm? I think you'll agree,  it adds a bit more life to the game..
Kaiba: We each begin with two thousand lifepoints; first player to hit zero loses! Are you ready to play, runt?.
Yugi: Playtime is *over*, Kaiba!.
Yugi: Yu-Gi-Oh...!!.
Kaiba: Ah...! What the?!.
Yugi (Yami): Now, Kaiba, prepare yourself, because it's time to duel!.
Kaiba: Virtual systems ready-- so let's begin! I attack with the mighty Hitotsu-Me Giant! Brace yourself, Yugi-- you've *never* dueled like this before!.
Hitotsu-Me Giant 1200/1000/L4/earth.
Yugi (Yami): Huh? He's brought the monster on the card to life!.
Kaiba: It's my virtual simulator.  It creates lifelike holograms of every duel monster! .
Yugi (Yami): So *this* is how you beat my grandfather! Well now it's *my* turn! I call on the Winged Dragon, Guardian of the Fortress!.
Winged Dragon, Guardian of the Fortress #1 1400/1200/L4/wind.
Joey: Wha--? Monsters? Real monsters?!.
Yugi: Fireball attack!.
Mokuba: Big brother! Are you all right?.
Joey: All right!! Go Yugi!.
Kaiba: Ha. Well-played, Yugi-- for a beginner. But how will you deal with *this*?.
Saggi the Dark Clown 600/1500/L3/dark.
Yugi (Yami): Saggi the Dark Clown? But that card has hardly *any* attack strength..
Kaiba: True, your Winged Dragon's attack is fourteen-hundred, while my Dark Clown's is only six-hundred, but if I combine it with *this* card....
Yugi (Yami): Ah! A magic card!.
Kaiba: Exactly. The "Negative Energy Generator". It multiplies my monster's attack by *three.*.
Kaiba: Dark Clown, attack with Dark Light!.
Kaiba: As you can see, combining cards can be very effective. .
Yugi (think): He's good. He knows every aspect of this game..
Yugi (think): But my grandpa put all his gaming knowledge, his whole heart, into assembling this deck. I have to believe it holds some secret strategy. .
Right Leg of the Forbidden One 200///dark.
Yugi (think): Huh? This card is useless. I can't beat the Dark Clown with this. I'll have to use a different monster, in defense mode. The monster will be sacrificed, but my overall lifepoints will be safe..
Kaiba: Dark Light attack!!.
Joey: Hang in there, Yugi!.
Kaiba: You're not faring any better than the old man did, Yugi. Your deck is just as *weak and feeble* as your grandfather! .
Yugi (Yami): *My grandpa* is a great man, and a better duelist than you'll ever be! He entrusted me with his cards, and I can feel his *heart* in this deck. I doubt you have that kind of faith in *your* cards, Kaiba! .
Kaiba: Wha?.
Yugi (Yami): But I *believe* in my grandpa's deck! .
Yugi (think): And my faith rewards me, with Gaia, the Fierce Knight! With a destructive power of twenty-three-hundred!.
Gaia the Fierce Knight 2300//L7/.
Kaiba: Ugh!.
Joey: Way to go, Yugi!.
Yugi (Yami): All right, Kaiba, your move..
Kaiba: Ha. This'll be over sooner than you think. I call on the Blue-Eyes White Dragon!.
Blue-Eyes White Dragon 3000/2500/L7/light.
Yugi (think): Huh? No way!.
Joey: Impossible!! We all watched Kaiba tear that card in half!.
Kaiba: Surprised? Did you think your grandfather was the only one to possess a Blue-Eyes White Dragon?.
Kaiba: Ha, your Fierce Knight is destroyed! Faith or *no* faith, you *will* fall before my superior monsters, Yugi. *Power* is what this game is all *about*, you fool. Faith is for losers-- like your pathetic grandfather! .
Horn Imp 1300/1000/L4/dark.
Beaver Warrior 1200/1500/L4/earth.
Kaiba: In your entire deck, there's not a single card that can stand up to a Blue-Eyes White Dragon! So what hope do you have against *two*?.
Kaiba: Why don't you just admit defeat, Yugi. .
Grandpa: Don't... give up... Yugi...!.
Yugi (Yami): I *won't* give up. Grandpa's counting on me. .
Yugi (Yami): Ah! A magic card! (announces) "Swords of Revealing Light"! It stops all monsters on the field for three turns!.
Kaiba: How desperate! What possible good will a three-turn delay *do* you? .
Yugi (think): He's right! What do I do?.
Yugi (think): I can't figure out what to do with these cards! They're just a bunch of *pieces*. How can I use them to battle an expert like Kaiba? .
Grandpa (VO): For someone claiming to have faith, you're giving up too easily, Yugi. .
Grandpa vision: Listen. Sometimes the cards are like a puzzle. You have to put all the different *pieces* in their proper place..
Yugi: Ah, like the Millennium Puzzle?.
Grandpa vision: Exactly. Each piece helps to build a greater entity. .
Yugi: Grandpa!.
Grandpa vision: Like the pieces of a puzzle, Yugi! Remember!.
Yugi (think): *Puzzle*?! When are the cards like a puzzle? Wait-- grandpa once said--.
FlashBack Grandpa: Duel Monsters contains only one unstoppable monster-- Exodia. But he can only be summoned by drawing all five special cards. A feat that to this very day, no one has ever accomplished..
Kaiba: Quit your stalling, Yugi, or you will *forfeit* the match!.
Yugi (Yami): I *never* forfeit!.
Yugi (think): Huh?! Another piece of the puzzle!.
Kaiba: Draw any card you like, it won't change a thing! My dragons may be frozen for another two turns, but my new monster is under no such spell! The Judge Man, with an attack power of twenty-two hundred!.
Judge Man 2200///.
Yugi (think): I can attack with the Dark Magician. But he won't stand a chance once Kaiba's dragons are free of my spell! .
Dark Magician 2500/2100/L7/dark.
Yugi (Yami): Dark Magician, attack!.
Yugi (Yami): Your Judge Man falls! .
Kaiba: Oh... A sacrifice that doesn't even faze me. And though neither dragon can move for one more turn, my next card is... the *third* Blue-Eyes White Dragon! .
Kaiba: Now, my dragon, attack!.
Kaiba: So tell me, Yugi. How's your faith *now*? On my next turn, all three Blue-Eyes White Dragons are free to attack. This game's over no matter *what* card you draw!.
Kaiba: You can't *possibly* stand against my three Blue-Eyes White Dragons. It's over, Yugi; you were *never* a match for me!.
Joey: Don' listen, Yugi!.
Yugi (think): Kaiba had three Blue-Eyes all along! He only wanted grandpa's card so it couldn't be used against him. My only chance now is to  assemble all the pieces of Exodia. But the odds are against me. I don't think I can do this...!.
Yugi (Yami): The deck! It senses my doubt!.
Yugi (Yami): Don't lose focus, Yugi, don't lose faith! *Concentrate!* Huh?.
Yugi (think): Our friendship symbol!.
Téa vision: Yugi, we're all right here with you. .
Tristan vision: Yugi, you've got to believe in yourself..
Joey vision: You can do it; just kick Kaiba's butt!.
Yugi (Yami): They're right-- I've got to believe in the cards like my friends believe in me!.
Kaiba: Draw your last pathetic card so I can end this, Yugi!.
Yugi (Yami): My grandpa's deck *has* no pathetic cards, Kaiba. But it *does* contain....
(He picks it up off the top of his deck, no longer in any doubt that it was there) .
Yugi (Yami): The unstoppable Exodia!.
Kaiba: Aagh! Impossible!.
Yugi (Yami): I've assembled all five special cards, all five pieces of the puzzle..
Exodia the Forbidden One 1000/1000/L3/dark.
Right Arm of the Forbidden One 200/300/L1/dark.
Right Leg of the Forbidden One 200/300/L1/dark.
Left Arm of the Forbidden One 200/300/L1/dark.
Left Leg of the Forbidden One 200/300/L1/dark.
Kaiba: Exodia! I-it's not possible! No one's *ever* been able to call *him*!.
Yugi (Yami): Exodia... Obliterate!!.
Joey: Ya did it! Yugi, you won!.
Mokuba: This *can't* be! My brother *never* loses!.
Yugi (Yami): You play only for power, Kaiba, and *that* is why you lost. But if you put your heart in the game, there is *nothing* you can't do. .
Kaiba: But- but *how*! How could I have lost to *him*!.
Yugi (Yami): Kaiba... if you truly want to know-- *open your mind*!! .
Yugi (Yami): There, Kaiba. Maybe now you will begin to *see*..
Grandpa: Ah?.
Téa: Grandpa's awake!.
Grandpa: Yugi won..
- Mister Pegasus, sir. Seto Kaiba, our undefeated champion; he's been defeated in a duel, sir....
- ...By someone named 'Yugi'..
Pegasus: Hmmm....
Tristan: Joey, make a move already!.
Joey: 'Kay, here ya go, tough-guy! My Rock Ogre's gonna rock ya block off!.
Rock Ogre 800/1200/L3/earth.
Téa: Hmm..
Happy Lover 800/500/L2/light.
Joey: *Yeah*, Téa, like that wimpy card has a chance against my giant rock guy! Give it u-u-up! Heehee!.
Téa: Guess I don't stand a chance, unless maybe I use-- the "Breath of Light" card..
Joey (to Yugi): Huh? Can she *do* that?.
Yugi: *Oh,* yeah. The "Breath of Light" wears down rock monsters-- reduces them to rubble!.
Joey: Huh?!.
Téa: That brings your lifepoints down to zero, Joey! Once again you lose and I rock!.
Tristan (impressed): You *stink* at this game!.
Joey: Ugh...!.
Joey: Tristan's right, Yugi. I *do* stink. I can't win at Duel Monsters to save my life! What is it, Yugi? Why can't I ever win? Teach me what I'm doin' wrong!.
Yugi: Well let's start by checking your deck, Joey..
Joey: Huh? 'Kay. Here ya go..
Yugi: Ah, thanks..
Joey: Powerhouse lineup, don'tcha think?.
Yugi (blurts it out): *No* one could win with *these*! Joey, your deck's filled with nothing but monster cards!.
Joey: You got it, I packed it with every butt-kickin' monster I could find! .
Yugi: But that's not how the game works!.
Joey: Huh?.
Yugi: Duel Monsters is all about *combining* your monster cards with your magic card, to increase their strength.  With no magic in your deck, your monsters will get creamed every time!.
Joey: Huh! See! That's the kinda stuff I need to know! Yugi, ya gotta help me learn *more*! .
Yugi: Uh....
Yugi: My *grandpa's* the real game expert in the family. Maybe *he* can help..
Yugi (calls): Hey, grandpa, I brought you a new student..
Grandpa: Huh? Student?.
Joey: I was hopin' since you know more about Duel Monsters than anyone, maybe you'd teach *me*. .
Grandpa: Teach *you*? Duel Monsters is a *very* complex game..
Joey: Yeah, tell me about it-- Téa beat me three games in a row!.
Yugi (brightly): *Actually* Téa beat you *five* times in a row, Joey!.
Joey: Five?! Aw, man! Huh?.
Grandpa: Hmm. Yes, I could teach you to be a *great* tournament duelist. But only if you're willing to spend endless days and sleepless nights filled with rigorous training!.
Joey: Aw, piece a' cake! .
Grandpa: With an attitude like that, teaching you might not be *worth* my effort!.
Yugi (aside): Nice goin' there, smart-mouth!.
Joey: Please, Yugi! Help me convince 'im! I *will* work hard, I promise!.
Yugi: Listen, Joey, teaching you Duel Monsters is too big a challenge, even for my grandpa. .
Grandpa (grudging): It's not... *impossible*..
Joey: Huh? You *mean* it, gramps? .
Yugi: Joey, he already said he can't do it, and if he can't do it, he can't do it..
Grandpa: I never said I *couldn't do it.* But if I agree you must work hard! .
Joey: I'll do anything! I promise, I promise!.
Grandpa: Hmph. Fine, then we'll begin your instruction immediately, my young friend, and believe me-- (cracks his knuckles) under *my* tutelage, you *will* learn! Now, can you name the most powerful duel monster?.
Joey: Uhhh... no..
Grandpa: Can you name the *weakest*? .
Joey: No-o-o....
Grandpa: You *do* know what a trap card is, don't you?.
Joey: Kinda... I-I have no idea..
Announcer: Good evening, duel fans and our ten-million viewers at home, and welcome to the Duel Monsters duel dome, where tonight, the Duel Monsters Regional Championship will be decided! Of the two-hundred duelists that have competed in this marathon tournament, only two competitors remain standing. Put your cards together for Weevil Underwood, the bug brawler!.
Announcer: And his opponent-- the number-one-ranked Rex Raptor, dino duelist!.
Joey: Bug-boy, versus dinosaur-breath? What kinda match is that, that shoulda been *me* in there! .
Téa: I know you've been training for weeks; but those guys are in another *league*, you're just not ready yet. .
Joey: Sure, rub it in!.
Yugi: And on top of that you're so tired you can't keep your eyes open..
Yugi (ruefully): I think grandpa's lessons have been a bit too tough for him....
FlashBack Joey: Ugh... so tired... must rest....
FlashBack Grandpa: You have no *time* for rest!!.
FlashBack Joey (starts awake): Waaaah! .
FlashBack Grandpa: Did you come here to learn Duel Monsters or did you come here to catch up on your sleeping!.
Tristan (whisper): Ya see, it's *true* what they say-- (louder) you snooze you lose!.
Joey: Ugh! I musta been *nuts* to think I could ever learn this crazy game!.
Grandpa: Time for your lesson. .
Joey: Wha!! We're not *done*?.
Grandpa (affectionately teasing): Not by a longshot, you slacker!.
Grandpa: Now, quit your whining, Joseph. I know you've been working long and hard, but you *really are* coming along as a duelist.  And I'm *quite* proud of you..
Joey: Gramps, thank y--.
Grandpa: Oh, by the way, Yugi!.
Grandpa: This package came for you..
Yugi: A package? What is it, gramps?.
Grandpa (shrug): *I* don't know. It just came in the mail. .
Yugi: Huh..
Yugi: It's from Industrial Illusions!.
Joey: Industrial Illusions? That's the company that makes the Duel Monsters game! Why the heck would they be sendin' a package to *you*, Yugi?.
Yugi: I have no idea. Is it possible they heard I beat the world champion?.
Téa: You mean, Kaiba?.
Yugi: Yeah. It wasn't an *official* match or anything, but Kaiba *did* drop out of the tournament because of *me*..
FlashBack Kaiba: Draw your last pathetic card so I can end this, Yugi!.
FlashBack Yugi (Yami): My grandpa's deck *has* no pathetic cards, Kaiba! But it *does* contain-- the unstoppable Exodia!.
FlashBack Kaiba: Augh! Impossible!!.
FlashBack Yugi (Yami): Exodia-- obliterate!!.
FlashBack Kaiba: Uuuaagh-- aaaaaaaagh!!!.
Joey: Just hearin' Kaiba's *name* gives me a headache! .
Tristan: Whoa! Guys, Raptor just stomped Weevil!.
Joey: Yugi-- these guys any good? .
Yugi: *Oh*, yeah. They're *both* pretty tough customers. Weevil specializes in insect cards, *and*, he's a great strategist. Then you've got Rex Raptor and his dinosaur cards; he uses their power to *overwhelm* his opponents. .
Joey: Itsy-bitsy bugs against duelin' dinosaurs? Raptor has got this one in the bag!.
Yugi: I wouldn't be so sure....
Rex: A-a-alright, Weevil. Consider yourself-- dinosaur chow! .
Two-Headed King Rex 1600/1200/L4/earth.
Announcer: Ooh! And Raptor plays the strongest card in his deck, the terrible Two-Headed King Rex! Looks like this match could be over, right here, right now!!.
Announcer: We're back, monster-fans, and with the Two-Headed King Rex in play, it looks like this duel is all done!.
Rex: Your move!.
Weevil: Heheheheh, and all *I* have is this *weak little bug*..
Announcer: Weevil Underwood counters, with a Basic Insect card!.
Basic Insect 500/700/L2/earth.
Joey: He plays a wimpy bug against a giant dinosaur? The place'll be covered in bug guts! .
Yugi: Maybe. But I wouldn't underestimate Weevil!.
Rex: King Rex, let's take this championship! Stomp 'em!.
Weevil: Heheheh, you've attacked your way into my trap! But then-- how could your tiny dinosaur brain know, when an enemy attacks, my vortex activates!.
Rex: Oh no! It's a trap card! .
Weevil: Which totally traps your King Rex in its inescapable embrace!.
Rex: Oh no! My King Rex!.
Weevil: And while he's trapped there, I'll upgrade my Basic Insect by giving him armor with laser cannon! .
Weevil: Not such a *weak* little bug after all, hmmm? Atta-a-a-ack!.
Weevil: And King Rex is, extinct..
Rex: Whaa...! (mutter) Beaten by a bug!.
Announcer: A stunning upset by Weevil Underwood, our newest champion!.
Joey: Man, King Rex squashed by an insect?!.
Announcer: And now, a very special honor for our new champion! Here to present the Duel Monsters Championship trophy, the creator of Duel Monsters and the president of Industrial Illusions, ladies and gentlemen and fellow duelists-- I give you Mister Maximillion *Pe-e-egasus!*.
Pegasus: Congratulations. .
Weevil: Uh... thank you! .
Pegasus: And as regional champion, I invite you to compete in a bold new tournament I'm hosting at Duelist Kingdom!.
- Mister Pegasus, with the announcement that you made tonight, we'll have *thousands* of duelists flocking to Duelist Kingdom..
Pegasus: Yes; an event such as this will hopefully attract those who possess the Millennium Items I seek. Which reminds me....
- The package was delivered to the boy, just as you ordered, sir. .
Pegasus: *Excellent!*.
Grandpa: Ha! With all the excitement of the Championships, you forgot to open your package, Yugi!.
Yugi: What could it be? (He lifts the flaps of the box) Huh?.
Téa: Some kind of glove..
Joey: And stars..
Tristan: Maybe there's an explanation on the video. .
Joey: Pop it in and check it out..
Yugi: Okay..
Pegasus (on screen): Greetings, little Yugi. I am Maximillion Pegasus. .
Joey: Pegasus?! .
Téa: We just saw him on TV!.
Grandpa: The famous Maximillion Pegasus sends greetings to *my Yugi*?.
Pegasus (on screen): I have heard some terribly *interesting* things about you, Yugi..
Yugi: Huh?.
Pegasus (on screen): Your impressive defeat of Seto Kaiba intrigued me *so* much, I've decided to investigate your *amazing* dueling skills personally! Right here, right now, we shall hold a *special* duel. We'll play with a strict time limit of fifteen minutes, and when time's up, the player with the highest lifepoints will be the winner! Are you ready?.
Yugi: Wha?.
Joey: Wha?! He can't seriously expect you to fight a duel against a *videotape*! .
Tristan: That's crazy!.
Pegasus (think): No-- it's *magic*!.
Yugi: Everything's growing dark and cold and the others aren't moving! (starting to panic) What've you done to them?! Where have you taken us?!.
Pegasus: Hmhmhm. We're no longer in the world you know. But I will return you-- after our game!.
Yugi: Then it's time to duel!.
Yugi: Yu-Gi-Oh...!!.
Yugi (Yami): Start the clock and make your move, Pegasus..
Pegasus: Certainly. Let's begin!.
Pegasus: Nervous, Yugi-boy? You *should* be. You have *never* faced a duelist like *me* before!.
Yugi (Yami): You may be good--.
Pegasus: -- I assure you I *am*--.
Yugi (Yami): But *I will beat you* to save my friends!.
Pegasus: You won't save *anyone* with that dragon card. .
Yugi (Yami): How--?! .
Pegasus: I *told* you you've never faced anyone like me before-- I know every move you'll make, *before* you can even make it! .
Pegasus: Knowing every move you'll make gives me a distinct advantage, wouldn't you say?.
Yugi (Yami): *What*?!.
Pegasus: For example, I can anticipate your next play, and counter it with this "Dragon Capture Jar"..
Pegasus: It will draw the Koumori Dragon from your card and imprison the beast! (and it does)  Trapped. Never to be played against me. .
Yugi (think): This is crazy! First he reads my mind, then he brings the monster on my card to life! .
Pegasus: This dark dimension we're in is known as the Shadow Realm, a mystical place where incredible monsters can be summoned and the *impossible* is *quite* possible! .
Yugi (Yami): But what you're telling me *can't* be true!.
Pegasus: Tell me, Yugi, do you believe there is *magic* in these cards?.
Yugi (Yami): Don't you *know*? You *invented* this game..
Pegasus: What if I told you I *didn't.*.
Yugi (Yami): Huh?!.
Pegasus: In ancient times, the Egyptians called this 'the Shadow Game'. Powerful pharaohs would hold mystical duels in other dimensions, just as we're doing now. But *not* with cards! They battled with *real* monsters, and *real* magic. Magical forces so powerful, the Egyptians lost control of them, and nearly destroyed the entire world!.
Yugi (Yami): It's a good *story*, Pegasus, but these monsters can't be real!.
Pegasus: Tell that to my Dragon Piper! As his flute of resurrection *frees* your Koumori Dragon, but puts him under *my* control!.
Dragon Piper /1800/L3/fire.
Yugi (Yami): I have to counterattack! Silver Fang!.
Silver Fang ///.
Yugi (Yami): Ugh! The heat! .
Pegasus: Ha! As you see, Yugi, these monsters are *very* real! Hmhmhmhmhmhmhm, and also quite *dangerous*! Hnhnhnhnhnhnhn! (He notices that Yugi isn't laughing.) Ah, Yugi-boy. You really are quite entertaining-- the way you *scowl* and *sneer*, so defiant and yet helpless, and so completely ignorant of the power of your Millennium Puzzle! .
Yugi (Yami): What?.
Pegasus: Five thousand years ago, a powerful pharaoh locked the magic of the shadow games away..
Yugi (Yami): What's this have to do with *me*?.
Pegasus: The Pharaoh captured these vast magical energies in seven mystical Millennium Items. .
Yugi (Yami): Seven items? You're saying that-- *my Puzzle's one of them?*.
Pegasus: Yes, and there are mystical energies locked within it-- magic that could change your life forever if you *only knew* how to unleash it! .
Yugi (Yami): But why are you telling me this?.
Pegasus: Why? Simply because I *need you to know*. But perhaps I have said too much. And since the clock is still ticking, I propose we resume playing our little duel. .
Yugi (think): He's right. Time's running out and I still haven't *figured* out whether he can really read my mind, or if it's some kind of trick. .
Yugi (think): Ugh, I've got to try *something*. Maybe my Zombie Warrior....
Yugi (think): Wait a minute! He definitely knows what I'm about to do. But how! It's gotta have something to do with that weird eye of his. (He briefly recalls seeing Pegasus pull aside his hair) That's it-- isn't it! That weird eye must've somehow let him see the cards in my hand! So no matter which card I pick, he's already one step ahead of me! But that gives me an idea....
Pegasus: Hurry up now, Yugi-boy; time is running out-- for you and your friends! .
Yugi (think): Pegasus is expecting me to play  one of the cards in my hand... but what if I play a card even *I* haven't seen yet! What happens if I draw a new card straight from the deck without even looking at it!.
Pegasus: I already know you plan to play the Zombie Warrior. And I'm already prepared, to counter it with a trap card that makes even *zombies* lie down and play dead!.
Yugi (Yami): Not this time. I figured out your little game, Pegasus. You may be able to see the cards in my *hand*, but you *can't* see the cards I pull from the *deck*! .
Pegasus: Hmm?.
Yugi (Yami): My next card is-- the Dark Magician!.
Dark Magician 2500/2100/L7/dark.
Pegasus: *Oooh,* the big scary Dark Magician. .
Yugi (Yami): Mock me all you like, Pegasus; but my Magician will *destroy* that dragon! .
Pegasus: Go right ahead if you think it'll help..
Yugi (Yami): It'll do *more* than *help*, Pegasus. It'll bring you closer to defeat, and me closer to saving my friends. .
Pegasus: If it can do all that, by all means *play* it..
Yugi (Yami): Dark Magician!.
Yugi (Yami): Dark Magic Attack!.
Pegasus: Ahh! .
Pegasus: Ahahahahaha! Nicely played! But by using your Dark Magician, you've let me manipulate you once again. By playing that one card, you have ensured my victory. .
Yugi (Yami): No..
Pegasus: We shall see, Yugi. (draw) Oh! A very *rare* card. This is the fearsome Faceless Mage..
Yugi (Yami): I've never seen *that* card before! But my Dark Magician is one of the strongest magic cards (sic) in the game!.
Pegasus: But how will he fare once I combine my Faceless Mage with the equally rare "Eye of Illusion"?.
Illusionist Faceless Mage 1200/2200/L5/dark.
Yugi (Yami): Dark Magician, Dark Magic Attack...!.
Yugi (Yami): Dark Magician! (think) ... My attack had no effect at all! .
Pegasus: Hmhmhm..
Yugi (Yami): His Faceless Mage should've been destroyed. But it's still standing and I'm running out of time. .
Yugi (think) I'm up by three hundred lifepoints, but only because Pegasus is toying with me. I've got to find a way to beat him at his own shadow game! .
Yugi (think): Pegasus knows all kinds of tricks-- but I gotta find a way to defeat 'im! I just have to trust in my grandpa's cards..
Yugi (Yami): I attack your combo with the Celtic Guardian! This mighty warrior will cut your Faceless Mage down to size!.
Celtic Guardian 1400///.
Pegasus: True, your Guardian is mighty; but you have once again underestimated the incredible power of my Eye of Illusion! Haha!.
Yugi (think): No!.
Pegasus: Dark Magic Attack! .
Yugi (Yami): But that's *impossible*! The Faceless Mage doesn't *have* a Dark Magic Attack.  Oh, no...!!.
Yugi (think): It was my *own* Dark Magician that attacked me. Pegasus is controlling him with the Eye of Illusion! But if he's using *its magic* to control my Magician, *what's protecting his Mage*...? .
Pegasus: Well, Yugi, our time together is nearly up. And as I've more lifepoints than you, it appears, I am the victor. .
Yugi (Yami): Time's not up *just yet*, Pegasus! And you've left your Faceless Mage vulnerable to a physical assault!.
Summoned Skull 2500///.
Yugi (Yami): Summoned Skull! Attack!!.
Yugi (Yami) : Ugh....
Pegasus: Hm, well, we've run out of time. But how close was that! If you had been able to complete that attack, I would have *lost*! But I didn't, did I. I have taken the measure of your talents this day, Yugi Muto, and when next we duel, we shall play for *far higher stakes!*.
Yugi (Yami): I'm *done* with your games! .
Pegasus: Tch-tch-tch,  you presume I'm giving you a *choice* in the matter. (He pulls aside his hair, revealing the golden eye) But-- I'm *not*! For I, too, possess one of the seven Millennium Items-- the all-powerful Millennium Eye! .
Yugi (Yami): A Millennium *Eye*?!.
Pegasus: That's right, Yugi-boy, and *now* I'll show you the *true* extent of its magic! .
Pegasus: You see, I have found that, given the proper incentive, *anyone* can be made to play my game!.
Grandpa: Yugi...!.
Yugi: Huh...? Grandpa! .
Yugi (concurrently): Grandpa? Grandpa?!.
Pegasus (concurrently): Yes, we *will* duel again, Yugi-- how else will you ever reclaim your grandfather's soul! Hahahahahahaha!.
Yugi (concurrently): Grandpa!!!.
Joey: *Man*. This Duelist Kingdom looks like a pretty big place, Yugi. Finding your grandpa's not gonna be easy. .
Yugi: Well, we gotta start somewhere..
Joey: Whoa, check out the *suits*..
Loudspeaker: Attention, all duelists. Please disembark in an orderly fashion..
Tristan: Hey Téa, what if one a' those security guys finds out we're both stowaways? We oughta just play it safe and swim back!.
Téa: We're *in the middle of nowhere*, lamebrain! If you can just try and act *normal*, we'll be okay..
Tristan (to himself): Just act cool. Act cool. Cool as a cucumber, keep it coo-oo-ool....
- Hey you!.
- Don't look so nervous, you guys are our guests here..
Tristan: That's right! I'm your guest! .
Tristan: I think I just had a heart attack!.
Téa (sarcastic): Way to play it cool, Tristan. *That* wasn't suspicious at *all*..
Joey: Mmmph! All right! Every single  one of us made it here safe a-- a-achoo!!.
Téa: Eeew!!.
Yugi: You would never have caught that cold if it wasn't for Weevil..
FlashBack Weevil: Say goodbye to Exodia-a-a-a!!.
FlashBack Yugi: My cards! Those were the Exodia cards that my grandpa gave me! .
FlashBack Joey: I'll get 'em!.
FlashBack Yugi: Joey, don't!.
Joey: Speakin' of our wormy friend, looks like he just slithered his way off the boat and is already lookin' to start some trouble. That slimeball, I'd *love* to wipe that smirk off his face..
Yugi (think): *I* would, too! But we don't have time for Weevil right now. .
Kemo: Welcome, all duelists. Please-- follow the stairs to meet your host!.
Yugi: That castle's gotta belong to Pegasus!.
Joey: Then what're we waitin' for!.
Téa: Huh? What's that?.
Yugi: Huh? What do you see, Téa?.
Téa: It looked like... Bakura..
Yugi: *Bakura?* From school?.
Tristan: *Again* with this Bakura stuff?.
Joey: Where is 'e, Téa?.
Téa: That's *two times* that I've seen him now. But, he's not there anymore. Maybe it's all in my head. .
Tristan: Come on, we're on a rescue mission, remember? .
- Wow, look, that's Weevil Underwood! He's the regional champion! .
- And that's the runner-up, Rex Raptor!.
- And there's Mako Tsunami-- he was ranked third!.
- Wow, these're all the best duelists in the world! But where's the world champion, Kaiba?.
- Didn'tcha hear? Some kid beat 'im! On his own turf, too. .
- Are you serious? I thought *Kaiba* was the best..
- He *was*, but not anymore. *Yugi's* supposed to be the kid to beat *now*..
Kemo: Attention..
Kemo: Please gather around. Your benevolent host is anxious to greet you all. .
Joey: Boy, would I like to get just  five minutes alone with that guy....
FlashBack Pegasus: Tch-tch-tch. When next we duel, we shall play for... far *higher* stakes! .
FlashBack Yugi (Yami): Huh!.
FlashBack Pegasus: You see, I have found that, given the proper incentive, *anyone* can be made to play my game!.
FlashBack Grandpa: Yugi...!.
FlashBack Yugi: Grandpa!!.
Yugi (think): I'm not leaving this island until I save my grandpa, no matter *what* Pegasus has planned for me!.
Pegasus: Greetings, duelists! I am Maximillion Pegasus! It is my great honor and pleasure to welcome you all to the Duelist Kingdom. .
Pegasus: You stand before me, the world's greatest duelists-- but come tournament's end, only one shall be crowned King of Games! .
Pegasus: I implore you all  to assemble your dueling decks with care; with creativity; *and* with cunning! For this competition will test your skills like never before! To track your progress in the tournament, you've each been given a dueling glove. You've also been given two precious star chips..
Pegasus: You must wager these star chips on each duel you compete in. To advance to the final level of competition for a chance at the three-million-dollar prize, you must win ten star chips! *Ten* star chips will admit you into my castle, where you'll face me in one final duel! .
Yugi (think): If grandpa's here, I'd bet my dueling glove he's hidden away in that castle! But I'll never be able to get in there with all the guards around. We're just gonna have to win enough star chips to get inside..
Pegasus: This will be a tournament unlike anything you have ever experienced! State-of-the-art dueling arenas cover this *entire* island, and intriguing new dueling rules will be in effect! I could *tell* you what these new rules are-- but what fun would *that* be!  You'll discover them as you compete, or you won't last very long! .
Pegasus: Remember-- play boldly; think strategically; and duel mercilessly! You have one full hour to prepare-- both your cards and yourselves. When the skies light up with fireworks, the duels will begin!.
Pegasus (think): The duelists have arrived. Yugi has taken the bait. And the games are about to begin! Everything goes according to plan!.
Yugi (think): I gotta win my way into that castle. I just *gotta*..
Joey: Yugi, I don't know if I can win this thing. Maybe it'd be best for you to take your star chip back. .
Yugi: Nah, you keep it. Your little sister's counting on you to win the tournament's prize money for her. .
Joey: Thanks, man..
Téa: You can do it! You've just gotta steer clear of the more experienced duelists at first. .
Tristan: Yeah, it's just a mater of working your way *up!*.
Joey: Thanks, you guys. Well, Yugi, between your grandpa and my sister, we don't have  any room for mistakes..
Yugi: Right..
Téa: The fireworks! It's starting!.
Yugi: Let's do it!!.
Joey: So, what's your plan, Yugi?.
Yugi: Well, I might as well stick with Weevil. After all, we do have a score to settle....
Joey (huge grin): I was hopin' you'd say that!.
Téa: Uh, isn't that him?.
Yugi: Huh? Weevil! (yells) Weevil!! I challenge you to a duel!.
Weevil: Ahahahahahahaha!.
Joey: I can't believe it! Weevil's runnin' away!.
Joey: Hey-- wait up!.
Tristan: Whoa! Where're all these moths coming from?!.
Téa: Ugh! They're disgusting!.
Tristan: He's fast, for a small guy!.
Téa: Maybe you're just *slow* for a *big* guy!.
Joey: We're never gonna catch 'im! As long as the whole island's in bounds, he'll keep runnin' all day!.
Yugi (think): What's Weevil *up to*? He's wanted to duel with me ever since we met on the boat; so what's he running for?  Wa-a-ait a minute... (aloud) What'd he say on the boat?!.
FlashBack Weevil: Everyone will soon learn that there are new rules on the island that require more strategy!.
Yugi (think): It must have something to do with the new rules! So I better figure out what-- and fast! .
Joey: There 'e is!.
Weevil: Welcome-- said the spider to the fly! You flew right into my trap!.
Weevil (VO): *Again!* .
Yugi: It's time you answer for what you did on the boat, Weevil!.
Yugi: Yu-Gi-Oh...!!.
Yugi (Yami): Huh! All right, Weevil, time to find out if you're as good at dueling as you are at running away! .
Weevil: Was I *simply* running away, or cleverly weaving you into my web!.
Yugi (Yami): It's time to *duel*!.
Weevil: Heheheheh... As you WI-I-I-I-I-I-ISH!!!.
Tristan: Ah! An earthquake!.
Yugi (Yami): What have you *done*?.
Tristan: Whoa! The entire ground is transforming!!.
Téa: It's gigantic!.
Joey: Man! These aren't gonna be like the duels back home!.
Weevil: You've just stepped into a hornet's nest-- and there's no way out!.
Yugi (Yami): What is *that?*.
Joey: These giant arenas must be set up all over the island!.
Weevil: I'll just meet you on the field!.
Joey: I don't like this. Weevil's a little *too* cocky..
Weevil: I noticed that you have just one star chip, Yugi. I guess that means I'll have the *pleasure* of eliminating you from the tournament! Once *you're* gone,  everyone else's chips will be easy pickings!.
Yugi (Yami): Not if I take *your* two first!.
Weevil: What?!.
Yugi (Yami): This will be an all-or-nothing match for the both of us. .
Weevil: Ha! Why should I risk *both* my star chips, when *you* only have *one*!.
Yugi (Yami): Because I have something else I think you want-- my whole Duel Monsters deck!.
Weevil: So! You'd risk your *grandpa's* deck? Fine with *me*! Eheheheheheheh! Winning all your cards will be an easy way to exterminate you once and for all!.
Téa (revolted): *Exterminate*?.
Joey: Swat that little twerp like a mosquito!.
- Whoa! Sounds like a duel is about to start over there!.
- That's Weevil Underwood-- but who's the other guy?.
Joey: *That guy* is Yugi Muto. He beat Kaiba. An' *I* happen to be his best friend Joey Wheeler. An' these two? These two are trespassers..
- I thought I wouldn't be seeing a Weevil-Yugi match up till the finals! .
- Weevil's a regional champ; no new kid's got a chance against him!.
Weevil: Well, Yugi, my *adoring* public is waiting, so, we should begin!.
Both: Duel!!.
Weevil: Let's see how you like my Killer Needle!.
Killer Needle 1200/1000/L4/wind.
Yugi (Yami): You'll have to get through my Mammoth Graveyard first!.
Mammoth Graveyard 1200/800//.
Yugi (Yami): This massive monster will match your annoying insect point for point! Attack!.
Weevil: Killer Needle, let's show the Mammoth your stinger! Attack!.
Yugi (Yami): No!!.
Weevil: Ha! Gone after one sting? He must be allergic!.
Yugi (think): I don't get it! Both creatures were evenly matched! It should've been a stalemate!.
Weevil: Have you begun to figure out yet why I led you all the way to this forest area? If you *just* look around, then you will see that this area is an exact replica of our surrounding environment. One part wasteland and one part forest. And who *thrives* in the forest?  Bugs! The strongest, most powerful insects *rule* the forest!! So as long as I play my bugs in the forest area, I get a field power bonus! I guess you *just weren't listening* when Pegasus said that this tournament would have exciting new surprises in store for us! Maybe if you were smart enough to steal the tournament's secret new rules like *I* did, you'd be getting a field power bonus instead of me! Ahahahaha!.
Joey: He cheated! He led us here 'cause he knew he'd have an unfair advantage!.
Weevil: Go ahead-- call me a cheater; you're all just angry that you didn't swipe the rules yourselves! And because you didn't, little Yugi's about to get stung!.
Yugi (Yami): Ha ha ha!.
Weevil: What?! How could you be laughing!.
Yugi (Yami): Because; take a look at your ferocious Killer Needle *now*..
Weevil: W-w-what? Oh no! My monster! What have you done with my monster?! Ugh!!.
Weevil: This makes no sense! My creature was supercharged with a field power bonus!  But according to *this*, Yugi's creature *somehow* became just as powerful!.
Yugi (Yami): Looks like my Mammoth got a field power bonus from the wasteland area just like your bugs do from the forest! .
Weevil: Rrrgh! The field point advantage was supposed to be mine alone! .
Yugi (Yami): I kept wondering about something on the boat ride here, Weevil. Why were we traveling to some remote island just to *duel*? But as soon as I saw this holographic display grid, it all came together. Every monster has a type of field that it does best on, kind of like a *home field advantage*. And what makes this island *so special*, is that it contains *every type of field imaginable*. So when you *deliberately* led us to this spot, you were clearly hoping to get some kind of field advantage. .
Weevil: Rrrgh... heeheeheeheeheheheheh! You're awfully clever to put it all together like *that*, Yugi! But figuring out *one* rule won't be enough! There are surprises hidden under every rock, and I know them all!.
Téa: You can beat 'em, Yugi! .
Joey: Don't let that flea scare ya! He's bluffin'!.
Weevil: *Really*?  Then let's just see how you handle *this* bluff. .
Hercules Beetle 1500/2000//wind.
Weevil: My Hercules Beetle will find a way to crawl under your skin!.
Yugi (think): Ahh...! Even though I know about the field power bonus, it's too late to rebuild my deck *now*. I guess a combo attack would be my best bet..
Yugi (Yami): I play Feral Imp! .
Feral Imp 1300/1400//dark.
Yugi (Yami): And now, I'll add this "Horn of the Unicorn" so its magic will raise my attack points. .
Weevil: Heeheehee! You'll have to do a lot better than that! Hercules Beetle, attack!!.
Yugi (Yami): Feral Imp, Magic Lightning attack!.
Téa: Yugi's attack didn't even *faze* that thing!.
Joey: Somethin's screwy!.
Yugi (Yami): My Imp's Magic Lightning attack should've destroyed your Beetle; is this *another* trick, Weevil?!.
Weevil (innocently nasty): No, *Yugi*, I just thought you *knew*  that all monsters with a field power bonus were *also* resistant to *any* type of magic attack! And since my Hercules Beetle *easily* deflected your lightning bolts, he has more than enough power left to destroy your puny Feral Imp-- and continue to eat away at your lifepoints!.
Joey: Even that four-eyed tick's *weakest* bugs're gonna be tough to beat, so long as he's got that field power bonus. .
Tristan: Yeah, but it's not exactly like it can just be *turned off*. .
Téa: That Weevil's a no-good cheat!.
Weevil: It's *your* turn! Make your move!.
Yugi (think): Maybe I should use my next monster to defend. By putting my card in defense mode, my monster *will* take a hit, but my lifepoints will be spared..
Weevil: So, we're *defending*, now, are we? Very clever! Since I can't see your monster's defense points, I can't be sure I can beat it, but even your *strongest* monster can't stand against my Basic Insect! .
Basic Insect 500/700//.
Weevil: Not only does he get a field power bonus, but I'm upgrading him with a  Level Three Laser Cannon, and a Level Two "Power Boost"!.
Yugi (Yami): No! His insect's so powerful now, my defense won't stand a chance, and after *it* falls, my lifepoints are next!.
Weevil: Now, Yugi, for all the innocent little bugs you've squashed, stomped, crushed, or fumigated, i-i-i-it's-- payback time!!!.
Weevil: Heheheheheh, you'll have to do better than that, if you hope to survive my bug's laser-powered arsenal!.
Yugi (Yami): Then I'll play *this* card. .
Weevil (think): Hmm. Another defense card, no doubt. And I'll make sure defending is *all* he can do! Heheheh! (aloud) I'm going to *keep* you on the defensive! Attack now, with *any* monster, and you will instantly activate this trap card! .
Tristan: That Weevil's got Yugi cornered!.
Joey: Yeah, he can't even counterattack!.
Weevil: As long as my trap card remains in play, you're *powerless* to make a move against me! *So*, does my tightening web *make you squirm*?.
Yugi (think): He's so busy bragging, he's not paying *any* attention to my moves. Maybe I can set a little trap of my own..
Weevil: Face it, Yugi, I've got you pinned down! And while you're totally unable to attack *me*, I can attack *you* anytime I want! Each turn you cower, I create a new monster!.
Gokibore ///.
(Yugi draws again.) .
Big Insect ///.
Weevil: Keep drawing, Yugi! My army of insects just keeps getting bigger! I'm going to wipe out all your monsters in one bug blitzkrieg!.
Kamakiriman ///.
Yugi (think): That's right, Weevil. Put all your monsters on the field-- that's *exactly* what I'm *counting on*!.
Téa: Just look at our Yugi; he's so confident up there!.
Joey: I know! When he's duelin' it's like he becomes a totally different guy!.
Weevil: Heeheehee, well what do you know! I'm down to my last monstrous insect, and you know what that means, Yugi! You're about to be exterminated!.
Yugi (Yami): We'll see what my cards have to say about that!.
Yugi (think): Yes! The Dark Magician! This is perfect; there's no way Weevil can resist *him* as a target! (aloud) All right, Weevil-- I defend with the Dark Magician!.
Weevil: *Excellent*, I'll destroy your very favorite card first! Now, my pet! Power up your laser cannon! Heheheheheheh! .
Weevil: Ata-a-a-a-a-ack!.
Yugi (Yami): Hmhmhmhmhmhmhm..
Weevil: Wha!! Why are you laughing?!.
Yugi (Yami): Weevil, you're not the *only * one who can set a trap card..
Weevil: What?!.
Yugi (Yami): You were so busy *grandstanding* you paid no attention to the cards I put into play. .
Weevil: But I thought they were all *monster* c-cards!.
Yugi (Yami): Not all. While you loaded the field with your *bug* monsters, I prepared a special surprise-- the power of my "Mirror Force" trap card!.
Weevil: Hold your fire!!!.
Yugi (Yami): Too late, Weevil, you've already ordered your attack on my Dark Magician. And Mirror Force will deflect it right back at *you*!.
Weevil: U-u-ugh... my lifepoints are devastated!.
Yugi (think): Yes!.
Téa (overlapping): He-e-ey! Yeah Yugi!.
Joey (overlapping): Way to *go*!.
Weevil (think): He obliterated my army of beautiful bugs...! How dare he!.
Yugi (Yami): You're a liar and a cheat, Weevil; but it was your *overconfidence* that allowed me to get the best of you. Your insects are decimated; your lifepoints are low; and as you yourself said before-- you have used up *all* your monsters!.
Weevil: Heheheheheheh! Actually, I lied about *that*, too! .
Yugi: Huh!.
Weevil: I still have my most formidable creature waiting in the wings! And this unconquerable insect will swat you down once and for all!.
Weevil: I-i-i-igh...!.
Joey: Ha! Great play, Yuge!.
Tristan: He wiped out Weevil's army in one move!.
Téa: All right! You've got 'im on the ropes!.
Mai: Ahaha! Yeah, *right*!.
Téa: Huh?.
Joey and Tristan: Mai!.
Mai: You losers don't seem to realize who your little pal is up against. Weevil's *regional champion*. He's got moves *your* shrimp couldn't even dream of! .
Téa (think): Ooh, that Mai! She's always butting in with her big mouth! Well, I'm not gonna let her trash *my* friends! (aloud) Nobody asked you! So why don't you just take a hike!.
Mai: And miss the chance to watch a champion like Weevil, as he turns this around? No way..
Joey: Yeah, I mean Weevil really came from behind to win the Regionals. .
Tristan: He's tough *and* sneaky..
Téa: Whose side are you two gooFlashBackalls on anyway?!.
Joey: All I'm sayin' is, for Yugi, this is his first official duel. .
Tristan: And he's fightin' a champ. .
Mai: Mhmhm!.
Téa (think): Oh Mai, you troublemaker! You think you know so much-- but Yugi'll *show you*!.
Weevil: You may have flattened my army of bugs, Yugi, but you haven't won! I have plenty of tricks up my sleeve!.
Yugi (Yami): You've done an awful lot of buzzing throughout this whole duel, Weevil, but I'm still here waiting for the sting. .
Weevil: Since you're new to this whole dueling tournament thing, I'll try to make this *simple* for you. I'm gonna wipe that goofy grin from your face! Now let's see which lucky bug gets to take the first bite! Heheheheheheheh....
Weevil: Oh! But this little bug won't stand a *chance* against all your *ferocious* monsters! Oh, well, I'll play him in defense mode. (think) Heheheheheheheh!.
Yugi (Yami): Huh. That would've been a nice bluff, but, I still haven't forgotten about the trap card you played!.
FlashBack Weevil: With this trap card, you won't be able to attack me with *any* of your monsters! .
Yugi (think): He didn't trap me then and he's *not* gonna trap me *now*. Weevil's trap card will activate as soon as I call an attack, and, it'll destroy all the monsters I have on the field. But, what if I get my monsters *off* the field first, and *then* destroy Weevil's trap! Oh, that's it! (aloud, Yami) I'll *spring* your trap, Weevil! But first-- The "Monster Recovery" card! It allows me to call back all the creatures I have on the field! Monsters, return to your cards! Now your *trap* has nothing to *snare*. And once my monsters are all safely back in my deck, the Recovery card also lets me draw a new hand. (He shuffles Dark Magician and Feral Imp back into his deck, and draws five cards) Now all I have to do is sacrifice one of my weaker monsters, and your trap is sprung..
Kuriboh 300/200/L1/dark.
Yugi (Yami): Kuriboh! Attack!.
Weevil: Aiissh! No!.
Yugi (Yami): Trap cards only work when they catch you by surprise.  Next time don't give your plan away!.
Weevil: Heeheeheeheehahahahaha! I *didn't*! I don't give a bee's behind about that stupid trap!.
Yugi (Yami): Huh?.
Weevil: I *tricked* you into recalling your monsters, so you couldn't attack *this*!! .
Larvae Moth 500/400/L2/earth.
Yugi (think): It's just a simple little Larvae Moth. That tiny creature can't be much of a threat. What's Weevil up to *now*? .
Weevil: Heheheheheheheh! Sure, he's just a little slug *now*-- but the Cocoon of Evolution will change all that!.
Cocoon of Evolution 0/2000/L3/earth.
Yugi (Yami): What!.
Weevil: Isn't it *beautiful*!.
Yugi (Yami): Ugh....
Téa: Ew. That's just gross..
Joey: Weevil's bug is sealin' itself in a cocoon!.
Mai (think): I *told* those chumps Weevil would turn this duel around..
Weevil: Behold! My Cocoon of Evolution! Hahahahahaha! Within that cocoon sits my tiny little Larvae Moth!  And over the next five turns he will undergo a startling transformation-- from harmless caterpillar to unstoppable Great Moth! .
Yugi (Yami): Then I'll *crack* your Cocoon before that happens! .
Weevil: Easier said than done, Yugi! For my Cocoon of Evolution also gets a field power bonus from the wilderness around us, increasing its defense points! It'll be so strong, you won't even be able to scratch its surface! (Cocoon's total defense points with the field power bonus are 2600) Just five more turns, Yugi! In five turns, my Great Moth will fully evolve and finish you off! .
Yugi (think): If what Weevil says is true, I'd better act fast. That-- *thing's*-- getting bigger and stronger with each passing second!.
Yugi (think): I have to find a way to break open that Cocoon *now*! I can't let that Moth get to its fifth stage of evolution. But do I have a card that *strong enough* to *stop* it? Hmm....
Gaia the Fierce Knight 2300/2100/L7/earth.
Yugi (Yami): Gaia the Fierce Knight!!  Shatter that Cocoon!.
Joey: Ah! The field power bonus makes it too strong!.
Weevil: That's one turn down! Care to try again? Ahahahahahaha! .
Yugi (think): Weevil's Cocoon is gonna be tough to crack; and for each attack that fails, my lifepoints go down..
Téa: Oh no....
Joey: Hang tough, Yugi-- you'll pop that pus-bag!.
Mai: Ahahahaha..
Téa (sharply): Just what do you think you're laughing at?.
Mai: All that stupid *cheerleading* you're doing. You make it sound like your 'Yugi' still has a chance. .
Téa: Nngh, *of course he does*! .
Joey: Don't listen to her, Téa. .
Mai: Any duelist that's ever gone up against Weevil's Cocoon of Evolution has been *totally* *trashed*..
Téa: Nngh--!.
Joey and Tristan: *All* of them?!.
Téa: But, Yugi's got *us* to help him beat it..
Mai: Hm! (think) He'll need a whole lot more than *you* losers!.
Weevil: Hear it growing?! The more time you waste, the more powerful it becomes! .
Yugi (think): If I don't come up with something quick, I'm not just gonna lose this duel,  I'll lose my only chance to save my grandpa. There's no way I can let that happen!.
Weevil: Tick-tock, tick-tock. Just four more turns until my ultimate insect emerges! Then you can stop worrying about how *you're* going to destroy *it*, and start worrying about how *it's* going to destroy *you*! Ahahahahahahaha!.
Yugi (think): Maybe I should prepare a defense, in case I really can't stop that thing..
Weevil: Huh! You're wasting your turn! *No* defense will save your lifepoints once my Moth is out! .
Yugi (think): I have to figure out a way to turn this duel around! Weevil's pretty confident that whatever's growing in that cocoon is unbeatable, but there's gotta be *some* way to pop that thing open-- and wipe that smirk off his face! But *how*?.
Téa: Hang in there, Yugi! .
Joey: Ya gotta win this for your grandpa! He's countin' on ya!.
Yugi (Yami): I know he is....
Joey: Then you can't keep lettin' this little creep push you around! Yugi-- ya gotta get fired up! .
Yugi (think): Wait-- that's it!! *Get fired up*!.
Mai: So d'you guys sit around and work up these lame cheers, or do they just come to you? I mean, don't you realize that your pep-talk nonsense only distracts Yugi from the game?.
Téa: How would *you* know? I bet no one's ever even *wanted* to be *your* friend, let alone *cared* enough to cheer you on..
Mai: Friends haven't helped *Yugi* any. He's *losing*. ...Huh?!.
Tristan: Yeah! Hey!.
Joey: Yess!!.
Téa: All right! *Well*, Mai, from the look on Yugi's face, I'd say that having friends just *did* help him out. So there!.
Mai (think): Brat. What *possible* idea could Yugi have gotten from *these* mental morons?.
Yugi (Yami): Go!! Curse of Dragon! Take flight! .
Curse of Dragon 2000/1500//.
Yugi (Yami): And, I'll combine it!! With this magic card! Attack, with Dragon Flame!.
Weevil: What do you think you're doing! You know your little firefly can't hurt my Cocoon! .
Yugi (Yami): Hmhmhmhm..
Weevil: What's so funny?!.
Yugi (Yami): Whoever said I was aiming for your Cocoon? I combined my "Burning Land" magic card with my Curse of Dragon, to destroy the forest all *around* your Cocoon! .
Weevil: No forest! That means-- I lose my field power bonus!.
Yugi (Yami): Exactly. Your Cocoon was too tough to attack directly-- but without its field power bonus, it's just a *big target*! .
Weevil: Aah! .
Yugi (Yami): Now *let's try this again*! Gaia, the Fierce Knight!! Attack!.
Téa: He did it!.
Joey: Popped it open like a *zit*!!.
Weevil: Hehehehehee....
Yugi (Yami): Hunh?.
Joey: Huh?.
Téa: Is it still *alive*?.
Joey: I've got a bad feeling we're about to find out....
Joey: Huh...?.
Téa (nervously): See anything?.
Joey: It's still... still *movin'*...! .
Mai: You're surprised?.
Yugi (Yami): Huh!.
Weevil: Heheheheheheh!.
Joey: It must've evolved enough to survive!.
Tristan and Téa: Ugh!.
Mai: I *told* you Weevil was good..
Weevil: I'm impressed that you pierced my Cocoon, Yugi, but still you were unable to stop the evolution of my ultimate insect-- the Great Moth! .
Great Moth 2600/2500/.
Yugi (Yami): But I thought, it took *five* turns..
Weevil: Heheheheh! So you stopped him one turn early! He's *still* strong enough to beat you!.
Téa: Oh no....
Mai (think): Ha! I notice that the little dweebs aren't cheering *now*! The Great Moth is an unbeatable creature. They can chatter from the sidelines all they *want*, but it won't help Yugi one *bit*!.
Yugi (think): Ugh, Weevil turned this match around once more-- but I'm not giving up! .
Weevil: Heheheheheh! So, Yugi, feeling outclassed yet?! Or perhaps you're enjoying your first major-league dueling loss! Heeheeheeheeh! .
Yugi (Yami): Hm. You may have gotten your prized monster onto the field, Weevil, but I'll still find a way to squash that oversized bug!.
Weevil: Ha! You'll pay for that stinging jab, *with your lifepoints*!!.
Yugi (Yami): Duel!!.
Weevil: Great Moth, take flight!!.
Yugi (Yami): So be it! We'll settle this in the skies!.
Weevil (think): Heh. Yugi's dragon is no match for my Great Moth, and none of his land monsters have the ability to attack me in the air! Heheh! But which puny creature should I obliterate first! (aloud) I think it's high time I pay back your Knight, for demolishing my Cocoon! .
Yugi (think): My Knight! He's the heart of my attack force! There's no way I can afford to lose *him*! .
Weevil: This is it, Yugi! My Great Moth will crush your defenses, slay your Knight, and blast your Dragon from the skies!.
Yugi (Yami): Not if *I* can help it, Weevil! Nngh!.
Weevil: But that's just it, you *can't* help it! Moth! Hurricane attack!.
Yugi (Yami): No! My Beaver Warrior!  Ugh, my defense. .
Weevil: It's hopeless! Nothing can stand against the gale-force winds of my moth hurricane! Your Knight will be totally blown away!.
Weevil: Hahahahaha! That'll teach 'im to mess with *my* cocoon!.
Yugi (Yami): Don't count on it..
Weevil: Hmm?!.
Yugi (Yami): Weevil, you were so busy fawning over your Moth, you didn't notice I played a "Polymerization" card!.
Weevil: But...! I thought...!.
Yugi (Yami): If I have two compatible monsters on the field, I can use my "Polymerization" card and fuse them into one ultimate creature. .
Weevil: I'm not some *beginner*, I know what fusion does!.
Yugi (Yami): Then you must know it increases my attack points. My fused Dragon-Knight combo is now powerful enough to go head-to-head with your Great Moth!.
Gaia the Dragon Champion 2600/2100//.
Weevil: Hahahahahahahaha! I wouldn't be so sure about that! Look again! .
Yugi (Yami): Huh...? No...!.
Yugi (Yami): My knight. He's losing points.  And fast. ...But how? And why?.
Weevil: Heheheheh. It's *poison*, Yugi. Poison particles from my Great Moth. Each time it uses its Hurricane attack, it releases *tons* of these tiny toxic particles-- and your *precious* dragon-knight combo is being poisoned by their deadly touch! Ahahahahahaha! .
Yugi (think): My Knight is losing points with each passing second! But how do I protect him against the very *air itself*?!.
Weevil: Looks to me like my poison particles are taking their toll, Yugi!.
Yugi (think): Oh no! My Knight's really in serious trouble. And there's nothing here in my hand that can help him. (draw) But I know my grandpa's deck won't let me down..
Yugi (Yami): Yes! Ready to be *rained out*, Weevil? "Makiu, the Magical Mist"! .
Weevil: No-- my poison! You're washing it all away!!.
Yugi (Yami): That's right; Magical Mist washes the field clean. .
Weevil: No fair! I was about to win and you save yourself with a little drizzle?! .
Yugi (think): It's true-- I saved my Knight, but that's not *all* I did!.
Weevil: All right, then; you may've stopped my poison attack, but I promise, you've only won a brief reprieve! Because my next move is one you won't be able to think your way out of! Brace yourself for my ultimate insect's ultimate attack! Great Moth! Tornado of Doom! .
Weevil: A direct hit! Hehehehehahahahah! Your little rainstorm didn't save you from *that* one, now did it! Your knight is toast! And you're almost out of lifepoints..
Joey: Yugi! Keep fightin'! You can come back from this! .
Mai: You're all delusional..
Téa: No, Joey's right! Yugi *never gives up*, and we never give up on him!.
Mai: You're nuts. Weevil has totally annihilated Yugi's strongest monster combo. He's down to fifty measly lifepoints; he *can't* win, so do me a favor and stop yapping. .
Téa: I *won't* 'stop yapping', you selfish, pompous, bleach-blonde, know-it-all windbag! Do *us* a favor and get lost-- right, Joey? .
Joey: You said it. Just ignore her, Téa; Yugi's in trouble!.
Téa: I *know*, what can we do?.
Joey: I dunno-- but it'd be *great* if we could trade *Mai* in for lifepoints. .
Téa: I *wish*!.
Mai: I told you all *along* Yugi never had a chance at winning this thing. .
Téa: Ugh!.
Mai: He wastes too much of his time listening to you *losers*. *Weevil* keeps his mind on the *game*. .
Tristan: Then why didn't he see *this* coming?.
Téa: Huh?.
Téa and Joey: See *what* coming?.
Tristan: Whatever it is Yugi's grinnin' about!.
Mai: Uh....
Joey: You're right; he's got a *big smile*..
Téa: Uh, he's not smiling. I think he's *laughing*..
Mai (you're kidding, right?): No way....
Yugi(Yami): Huhahahahahahaha!.
Weevil: Hey, hey! What are you so happy about?! *Stop that snickering*!!.
Yugi (Yami): Weevil, I know it will be very difficult for you to accept *losing* a duel... .
(Weevil does not like the sound of that at all) .
Yugi (Yami): ...Especially after spending so much time finding inventive ways to cheat! But if you thought bending the rules would help you in *this* match-- you're wrong..
Weevil: No! This is a trick!.
Yugi (Yami): You play dishonestly, so you expect the same of your opponents; but I duel with honor, Weevil-- and that makes all the difference! .
Weevil: You've got nothin'!!.
Yugi (Yami): *Here's* what I've *got*. The mighty-- Summoned Skull!!.
Summoned Skull 2500/1200/L6/dark.
Mai: Whoa...! What's *that*?.
Yugi (Yami): This is it, Weevil. Your ultimate insect won't withstand my next attack..
Weevil (think): Ha! Yugi must be losing it! His Summoned Skull *is* strong, but my Great Moth is stronger still! If he's foolish enough to attack, my monster will most certainly squish *his* monster, and wipe out the rest of Yugi's precious lifepoints as well! .
Yugi (Yami): Hmhmhmhmhm. There's something you *overlooked*, Weevil.  My Magical Mist is still dampening this entire field. .
Weevil: He's right...! Everything's wet! My Great Moth is totally soaked!.
Yugi (Yami): And my Summoned Skull attacks with electricity, making your waterlogged *bug* a giant-sized lightning rod. I hope you're in the mood for some fireworks, Weevil; because all this water boosts my monster's electrical attack by one thousand points! Summoned Skull!! Lightning Strike!.
Weevil: Ahh....
Yugi (Yami): It's over. I've won. .
Weevil: No! Impossible! My Moth's unbeatable!.
(Weevil's lifepoints are zero; he falls over, stupefied.) .
Joey: All right, Yugi! .
Tristan: Way to go!.
Joey and Tristan: Yeah!!.
Téa: He won! I knew you would!! .
(Mai stands there with her mouth open for a moment, then recovers, grudgingly impressed.) .
Mai: ...Impressive. *I* didn't think *Yugi* could ever beat *Weevil*..
Weevil: Uhhuh! But I'm the regional champion! The regional champion! Nnngh...
Yugi (Yami): You call yourself a champion, Weevil, but you only won your duels through lying and cheating. True champions-- they play with honor. They play *fair*. .
Joey: Ah, don't waste your breath on this sneaky slug! He's a duelin' disgrace! .
Joey: And I hereby relieve him of his dueling gauntlet!.
Yugi (Yami): *There*. Three star chips so far. But I still need to win seven more....
Yugi (Yami): Ten star chips will gain me entry into that castle, where they're holding my grandfather prisoner-- and where I'll battle Pegasus once and for all!.
Pegasus: Hmhmhmhmhmhmhm. All over the island, my unwitting pawns are in place. The duels have begun--.
Pegasus: ... And by *now*, the slow process of elimination is *well* underway..
Pegasus (VO): Only the strongest Duel Monsters players will survive, and those of *insufficient* skill will fall by the wayside. .
Joey: Okay, bring 'em on! I'm itchin' to duel and I'm takin' on the next player we see!.
Téa: Y'know, I'm not so sure Joey's up to this. .
Tristan: Yeah, there are tournament-level players here. But don't you think he's smart enough to realize....
Joey: Here I stand, the next Duel Monsters *champion!*.
Téa: He needs a reality check. .
Tristan: Guess he's about as smart as he *looks*..
Joey (mutters): I *better* be the champion... (think) For Serenity's sake. She's always counted on me, even when we were kids....
FlashBack Young Serenity: Where are we, Joey? Where have you taken me today, big brother?.
FlashBack Young Joey: To the beach. That's what you said you wanted..
FlashBack Young Serenity: Hey, Joey? .
FlashBack Young Joey: Yeah? .
FlashBack Young Serenity: You're the world's *best brother*!.
FlashBack Young Joey: Heheheheh..
FlashBack Young Serenity: Oh, *Joey*! It looks so-o-o *pretty*!.
FlashBack Young Joey: *And* so *cold*!!.
FlashBack Young Serenity: Hm?.
FlashBack Young Joey: What a great day. We gotta come back here!.
FlashBack Young Serenity: ...But how?.
FlashBack Young Joey: Don't worry. Even if mom and dad *do* get divorced, and we have to live apart, I'll still... bring you back to this place someday. .
FlashBack Young Serenity: You promise?.
FlashBack Young Joey: Yeah-- I *promise*. .
(Seagulls cry overhead against the shining white clouds, as Joey stands there lost in thought) .
Joey (think): I'm your big brother, Serenity; I'm supposed to take care a' ya. I'm gonna win this tournament *and* the prize money. I'm gonna make sure you don't lose your eyesight, and show you that beautiful ocean one more time-- *I promise*. .
Téa: Look there!.
Tristan: Duel Monsters stadiums! Look at 'em-- they're all over!.
Yugi: You said it! Lots of dueling going on! .
Joey: Right-- I'm goin' in! .
Tristan: You sure you wanna do this? If you lose, you give up your only star chip!.
Téa: That's right..
Joey: Gggh! .
Yugi: Don't panic. You can *do* this, Joey. You *do* know that, don't you?.
Joey: I hope you're right, Yugi; this'll be my first official duel, and I can't afford to get knocked out at the *start*!.
Yugi: True; but not everyone here is a pro. I'm sure you can find someone on *your* level. .
Téa: Go for someone easy, Joey..
Joey: An', I guess I should think about which field my cards're best suited for. They're mostly monsters and fighter-types. I...  guess that makes this meadow region my kinda turf!.
Yugi: That's right, Joey. See? You know what you're doin'! .
Mai: You *lost*, crybaby, now give me your star chips!.
Téa: A voice that *annoying* could only belong to-- *Mai*!.
- It's not fair, you cheated somehow! How could you know what your cards were when they were still facedown!.
Mai: I'm *psychic.* And you're, (wink) *done*..
Mai: *Well*. Look who's here! .
Joey: Wow; Mai's already won two more star chips. .
Mai: Hey, Yugi! Are your duels going well?.
Yugi: I'm making progress. .
Mai: So you have three star chips, do you? I might be up for a duel myself! .
Téa (sotto to Yugi): *Take her*!.
Yugi: Huh?!.
Téa (sotto to Yugi): Knock her out of the contest and *off the island*!.
Mai (still fake-friendly): Mmm! You know, I'm *definitely* in the mood for a duel right now! So get ready, because I choose to challenge... *you*, Joey!.
Joey: Whaa? You challenge *me*?.
Mai: Do you have the *guts* to accept?.
Mai: Get it? I wanna play *you*, kid..
Joey: Huh! Guess you heard about my skill..
Mai: *Don't* flatter yourself. I overheard you and Yugi talking on the boat, and I *know* he gave you the *only* star chip that you have. My motto is, take out the *weakest players first*. (wink) And considering that you wouldn't even *be* here if Yugi hadn't given you one of *his* chips, you've got to be *the* weakest duelist on the island!.
Joey: Hey... do ya have to be so *insultin'*?.
Téa: This time she was being *truthful.*.
Joey: Who!.
Téa: Mai's ruthless; don't duel her first!.
Tristan: Don't you get it? If you lose this contest, you're out for good!.
Téa (sotto to Yugi): Yugi, stand *up* for Joey! You have to fight her in his place. .
Yugi: This is *his* decision to make. .
Yugi: Show Mai what you're made of!.
Joey: Right-- she thinks I'm a pushover, but she'll see!.
Téa: *Yugi*!.
Tristan: You can't be serious, Joey! .
Joey: I've never been *more* serious! Don'tcha see, this is my chance to prove myself. To show *everybody*. Don't forget, Gramps trained me... .
Joey: I mean, sure, Gramps didn't get a chance to *finish* my training, and, granted, I wish I'd had a chance to practice more before getting thrown into a tournament *this huge* with so many heavy-hitters, but honest-- I think I can take 'er..
Tristan: Oh, man. You'd better be right, for your sister's sake..
Téa: Yeah, you'd better not screw this up, Joey..
Joey (to Mai): I accept. Let's duel..
Mai: Get ready to *lose*!.
Téa: Go get 'er, Joey!.
Tristan: Kick her butt!.
Joey: Yeah!.
Yugi (murmurs): He'll do fine..
Mai: Since you only have one *measly* star chip, I only have to bet one of *mine* against you..
Joey (think): At least this region'll give me a field advantage... (aloud) Huh? Oh, no!! What're all those mountains doin' on my field!!.
Mai: The field we'll battle on is forty-percent forest, forty-percent mountain, and the last twenty-percent is meadow. So deal with it or surrender. .
Yugi: Calm down, Joey, you'll be okay! Your monsters will still get a  field power bonus on the meadow part of the field! .
Joey: Oh. Yeah. Listen, Mai-- not for nothin', but I gotta ask you one question before we duel. .
Mai: Hmm? What?.
Joey: Why did you decide to take part in this tournament? Tell me, Mai-- why is it you *duel*?.
Mai: *Why* do I *duel*? .
Mai: For all the comforts that I crave! Designer clothes, travel perks, *anything* to avoid *real* work! Hot cars, turbo-charged for livin' large!.
Joey: Huh! So that's why you want the prize money? How selfish!.
Mai: How dare you try and judge me, who d'you think you are, you pathetic little snot!!.
Joey: Hey, you're only duelin' for *things*. But for your information, some of us fight for the people we love..
Yugi: You'll show 'er, Joey. Show her what it's like to duel from the heart!.
Joey and Mai: Duel. .
Joey: Hmm, so to start the game off, Masaki, the Legendary Swordsman!.
Masaki the Legendary Swordsman 1100/1100//earth.
Joey: The field power bonus will bring his power up over three hundred points!.
Joey (triumphant): Hey, I made my first move!.
Mai: Hm!.
Joey: Huh?.
Joey: Whaddaya think you're doin'!.
Mai: Divining my card. I have to mystically choose which one of them's the best..
Joey: Eh?! What're ya... a *psychic*?.
Mai: And the best card would be... Mm. The Harpie's Lady! Harpie Lady 1300/1400//wind.
Mai: Her strength is boosted by the mountains' field power bonus!.
Joey: I'll *still* take it on! Atta-a-a-ck!.
Yugi: Joey, wait! Land monsters are at a disadvantage to flying monsters!.
Yugi: Monsters that can fly have a *magical resistance* against monsters that can only walk on the earth!.
Téa: So Joey blew it already?.
Yugi: No, but he attacked too soon before he thought about what her monster was capable of..
Joey: Huh! My samurai's *sushi*!.
Mai: Ohh, cards,  *speak* to me...! Mm-mm-mm... And I'll choose again-- without *looking*. .
Joey: Huh?! How's she *doin'* that?!.
Téa: He's losing it!.
Tristan: Guess that mop-head *wasn't* ready for this duel..
Yugi: Hey, Joey! *Think about what you're doing* before you move again!.
Joey (think): How can she read the cards when they're lyin' facedown?.
Mai (think): Ha! My little card trick has made this kid forget everything he ever *knew* about Duel Monsters! All *I* have to do is just *keep pushing his buttons.*.
Joey (think): What do I do? (aloud) Maybe, *this* one! Tiger Axe!.
Tiger Axe 1300/1100/L4/earth.
Joey: My field power bonus should raise its attack power, so it can take on the Harpie's Lady head-to-head!.
Yugi: You're not *thinking*! It's still resistant to magic!.
Mai: Right. Tiger Axe is another handicapped *earth-based* monster! .
Mai: Hmph! It'll take stronger monsters than your land-based *wimps* to beat my Harpie's Lady! Now I'll play *this* lovely card  without even looking. .
Mai: I'll give you a hint-- it's an equipment magic card that will help me defeat *your* next card in *one turn*..
Joey: Again with all that psychic stuff? (think) Can she see *my* cards, too? Since I can't see what she's playin', I gotta get defensive..
Mai: Running scared, huh? Well let me *show* you my surprise-- "Cyber Shield", to juice up my Harpie's Lady!.
Joey: How's she *doin'* that?!.
Mai: Ahahahahaha, this is so much *fun*! In case you were wondering, the *next* card you were thinking of won't work *either*. .
Joey (mutters): Mai has ESP, that has to be it...! I'm gonna lose this duel match, and the chance to save my sister!.
Mai: Ahahahaha! This game is mine! You can't *win* against *me*..
Joey: She's right, she's too much for me!.
Yugi: *Settle down*.  Joey, remember what my grandpa taught you about how to play Duel Monsters. .
Téa: Don't let her rattle you! She's just trying to psych you out!.
Mai: Mm?! Stay out of this!.
Téa: Huh? .
Mai: Your brainless cheerleading isn't going to help him against the superior power of my Harpie Ladies. Don't you guys get it yet? Friendship doesn't win duels, never *will*. It hasn't helped *him*. He's defeated and he *knows* it..
Téa: Not true!.
Mai: No? I beg to differ. There can be only *one* champion. On this island, in this game, someone can be your best friend *today* and your worst enemy *tomorrow.* Once the competition forces you to face each other in a *duel*... where's your *friendship*, *then*? .
Joey: Huh?.
Mai: That's why the only person a duelist can trust is *himself*. I hope that your defeat today teaches you that lesson, kid. .
Tristan: He's losin' it!.
Téa: He needs help; Yugi, *help him*!.
Yugi: Yu-Gi-Oh...!!.
Yugi (Yami): Don't listen to her, Joey-- we're here to *help* you, just like you're always there for *us*!.
Mai: Huh?.
Joey: W-wha?.
Yugi (Yami): Trust me on this. She's just trying to divide and conquer, a strategy that's been used for *centuries*..
Yugi (Yami): Believe me-- I know..
Joey: When you get that look in your eye, I believe everything... you say..
Mai: Hahahaha! D'you really think Yugi wants *you* to be the grand-prize winner?! *He's* a duelist too, ya know. To win you'll eventually have to take *him* on..
Joey: She's right; we *will* hafta duel... but....
FlashBack Joey: Yugi, you're the best friend I ever had. Don' worry, we'll rescue your grandfather. We'll do it together-- we're a *team*..
Joey (mutters): We *are* a team. But I also have to win the contest, for Serenity....
FlashBack Serenity tape: I'm sending you this video just so you don't forget your little sister's face. It seems like I'm running out of time; take care, Joey..
Joey: What do I do? Maybe Yugi's right about this thing. I have to stop listenin' to Mai's nonsense, and *start* usin' my head. .
Joey: Rrrgh, I just gotta concentrate on how to win the game! .
Joey (think): ...There's *gotta* be a way to beat Mai. If I can just figure out how she knows what her cards are... if she's not psychic, there must be somethin' *else* she's doin'. (sniff) What's that *strange smell*? I never noticed that smell when my eyes were open. I'm smellin' a buncha different *perfumes*, comin' from... her cards! Huh..
Mai: Let's go, kid, it's your turn..
Joey (think): That's *it*! (aloud) I see through your card trick! You sprayed all your cards with *different perfumes*. An' by smellin' each different scent, you can tell which card is which, even when they're facedown!.
Mai: Uh!.
Joey: So you don't have to *look* in order to play your cards.  That way you can psych the other player out. .
Mai: No way! How could an amateur punk like *you* see through my aroma strategy! It's just impossible!.
Joey: I gotta admit, Mai, ya really had me buyin' in to the whole 'psychic power' schtick. I was too freaked out to think things through because a' that. (points, accusingly) But you're not a psychic at all! You're just a big *fake*!.
Yugi (Yami): All right, Joey!.
Téa: Go get 'er, Joey!.
Tristan: You da man!.
Joey: Yugi, you were right!.
Mai: Just because you saw through my little psychic *act*, doesn't mean you're going to be able to defeat me *in a duel*!.
Joey: I think you're wrong. Before you were winnin' by confusin' me and trying to pit me against my friends; but now my mind is clear. I know who I can trust. All you've got left is your cheap tricks, and I won't fall for 'em anymore!.
Mai: Uh-.
Joey: I'm gonna blast your Harpies outta the sky wit' *this*!.
Yugi (Yami): Good card, Joey!.
Joey: Baby Dragon!.
Baby Dragon 1200/700/L3/wind.
Mai: Ha! *That* wimpy card is your *grand play*? I only wish it was worth some more so when I *devastate* you  it'll do more damage to your lifepoints! (sic) *My* card will be, "Elegant Egotist"! Its magic will make *duplicates* of my Harpie's Lady (sic)!.
Joey: Oh, no!!.
Mai: Harpie's Lady (sic) *one*....
Mai: ...*two*....
Mai: ...*three*!.
Joey: It's three times the trouble!.
Téa: *Now* what? He was struggling when there was only one!.
Tristan: Don't give in, Joey! You've still got all kinds a' moves left!.
Téa: Really? What moves would those be?.
Tristan: How would I know? Ask an expert-- ask *Yugi*..
Yugi (Yami): It's Joey's duel; *he has to figure it out*..
Joey (mutters): I don't have any cards strong enough to beat three Harpie Ladies....
Mai: Ha! And I'm going to *keep* using the magic of "Elegant Egotist" to double my Harpies again and again each turn! Ahaha! But *while* my Harpies multiply, I can't attack you, so it's *your move*. Of course you'll soon be up against an *army*! .
Joey (mutters): An army of Harpies? How the heck do I fight an army?!.
Joey: She's got a whole army! How'm I supposed to beat *that*?!.
Yugi (Yami): Don't give up, Joey!.
Joey: Huh?.
Yugi (Yami): Think hard about her strategy; she's been using *only one* monster card, and strengthening that *one card* with *many* magic cards. But there's a *serious flaw* in her dueling strategy, Joey!.
Joey: Usin' magic on one card? That's true! She's just been juicin' up the Harpie Ladies every turn; but if she has mostly magic cards, maybe the Harpie Ladies are her *only* monsters! I bet if I can just defeat 'er Harpies, she won't have any monsters left to *play*!.
Yugi (Yami): That's right, Joey, now think-- what card in your deck will *help you win*?.
Joey: Which of my cards? You tell *me*. (think) Wait-- I think maybe you *did*!.
FlashBack Yugi: "Salamandra", and a "Kunai With Chain", Baby Dragon, and "Shield and Sword"? *Great*! With these new magic cards, *combined* with your monsters, you'll have a real strong deck!.
FlashBack Joey: All right!.
FlashBack Yugi: Here-- add *this* to your deck. It can be helpful in a tight spot..
Joey: The Time Wizard... This is the kind a' tight spot Yugi musta been talkin' about. Now if I can just remember what Gramps taught me about the way to use a magic card; 's my only chance. But, do I have it in my hand?.
Mai: If I'd known how long it was going to take you to make a move, I would've brought a *magazine.*.
Joey: Uh-oh. The Time Wizard's not in my hand. Ah, I'll have to *draw* for it. .
Joey: But what if I don't get it? Rrgh, what if....
Yugi (Yami, think): Trust in your cards, Joey, trust in your*self*!.
Joey: Uh, here I go. It's all or nothin'! Rrrgh!!.
Joey: Hm? All *right*!! It's the Time Wizard!!.
Time Wizard 500//L2/light.
Mai: Hm? What good is *that* thing?.
Joey: Don't you *know*? the Time Wizard can make time go faster, causin' my Baby Dragon to grow into a *Thousand* Dragon!.
Yugi (Yami): Right, Joey; and that's not the *only* effect your Time Wizard will have..
Time Wizard: Time magic!.
Joey: Baby Dragon, transform into-- Thousand Dragon!.
Thousand Dragon 2400/2000//.
Mai: So now you have a bigger dragon. Big deal! My Harpie Ladies *still* have greater attack power! Attack it, my three Harpie sisters! .
Mai: What?! What happened to my Harpie Ladies?! They've gotten so *old*!.
Yugi (Yami): Heheh. I *warned* you; a millennium has passed on the playing field, and your Harpie Ladies have become old and decrepit. Face it, Mai-- time's running out for you *and* your *ladies.*.
Mai: Nnnggh....
Joey: I believed...! And the cards came through for me! Awesome!! Go, Thousand Dragon!.
Joey: Attack with Inferno Flame Breath!.
Téa: He did it, Joey won!!.
Tristan: I *knew* you could do it!.
Joey: Thanks, guys!.
Mai: Nngh, *how*! How could I ever lose, to such an *amateur*! .
Joey: Hey-- Mai..
Mai: Huh?.
Joey: I tried to tell ya, there's more to Duel Monsters than just kickin' the other guy's butt. .
Joey: If you're ever gonna be a real champion, ya gotta learn to *care* about someone. Other than yourself. Isn't that right? Yugi?.
Yugi (Yami): Mmm-hmm!.
Yugi (think): I'm proud of you, Joey. All your hard work and training paid off. You went from a guy with nothing but eagerness and attitude, to a winning duelist who battles with his head, *and* his heart. .
Joey: Whoo-whee! Haheh, two stars! Hmhmhm, this is so awesome, I can't believe it happened! Am I cool or what! Heheheh! .
Téa: Is there a time limit on how long he gets to crow?.
Tristan: Cut 'im some slack, Téa. Did you ever think Joey would actually *beat* Mai in a duel? .
Tristan: I mean, *Joey*... who would've thought?.
Yugi: *I* knew he'd do it! I'm really proud of you, Joey. .
Joey: Yeah! (his stomach grumbles) Ugh, all that duelin' made me hungry! Did any of you guys remember to bring any food wit'cha?.
Yugi, Tristan, Téa: Sorry, Joe..
Joey: Ogh! What were we *thinkin'*, comin' here wit' no food? How're we ever gonna get through the rest of the competition without anything to eat? .
Yugi: That's a *good question*, Joey. This dueling *really* takes it out of you, and I haven't seen any burger stands or restaurants since we got here..
Téa: Well, we better do something fast! I've gotta have my five basic food groups, or else-- it's *metabolic meltdown*!!.
Tristan: Hey, chill out, you guys,  I got it covered! .
Yugi, Joey, Téa: Yeah?.
Tristan: Check it out, the Great Outdoor Survival Guide!.
Yugi, Téa: Ugh....
Joey: Can we eat it?.
Tristan: Better than that-- it lists all the plants, berries, and grasses we can eat!.
Yugi, Joey, Téa: Eeew!.
Joey: Do I look like a squirrel, ya big doofus?! (sniff sniff) I don't need your dumb book anyhow; I smell somethin' cookin' that-a-way! Hah! See yuh!.
Téa: He's hallucinating..
Tristan: Don't be so sure. Ya know, it wasn't his *brain* that beat Mai, it was his *nose*..
Joey: Mmm, aw, man, I just love barbecued fish! .
Yugi: Smells good....
Joey: Aw, yeah, and I bet it tastes even better!.
Téa: *What* makes you think those fish are yours to eat?!.
Joey: Hey, trust me-- we eat first and ask questions later! Your stomachs'll thank me! Heeheeheehee!.
Téa: *Joey*! Ugh, he'd say anything to fill his belly!.
Tristan: Some people have absolutely *no* self control..
Yugi and Téa: Huh?.
Tristan: Joey, save some for me-e-e!.
Téa: Ugh... .
Joey: Ahh, man, this looks awesome!.
Tristan: Ow! Owow! Hot, hot!.
Joey and Tristan: Ready, set, feeding frenzy!.
Mako: Enjoy yourselves, you fish thieves, this is your last meal!.
Mako: How *dare* you eat my fish, you thieving poachers! Has no one taught you manners--.
Yugi: Uh....
Joey: So, can we eat now?.
Mako: Alright, let's try that one more time. .
Téa (mutters): I *knew* this was a bad idea....
Mako: Rrgggh, how *dare* you steal my fish, you bottom feeding thieves!.
Joey: Heeey, chill out, guy, it's just a few fish..
Mako: A *few fish* that do not belong to you! And to steal a fisherman's catch is to *prove* you have no honor! .
Yugi: A dueling glove...? Wait a second! Aren't you Mako Tsunami, the top-rank ocean duelist?.
Mako: Mmmgh-- And who might *you* be?.
Joey: Yeah, you're that freaky fish guy. .
Mako: I am NOT a *freaky fish guy*!! I am Mako Tsunami, duelist extraordinaire of the seven seas! .
Mako: Ehh, what are you *laughing* about?.
Téa: Heheh, your *head*! You've got company!.
Mako: Huh...?.
Joey: Hahaha!.
Mako: Rrrgh, *off* with you!.
Tristan: No, don't!.
Joey: I wanted to eat that!.
Tristan: You're demented..
Mako: Hunh. Are you telling me that *those two* are here as *duelists*?.
Yugi: I'm Yugi Muto. Sorry about your fish..
Mako: *You*? You're Yugi Muto, the only duelist to ever defeat Seto Kaiba? Hahah! What a fine surprise! It will be my very great honor to face you in a duel!.
Yugi: Same here, Mako. .
Mako: I must apologize; I've been ungracious. If you are friends of Yugi Muto, please! Come sit down, eat your fill! .
Joey and Tristan: Tha-a-anks!.
Mako: You are welcome..
Joey and Tristan: Feeding frenzy!!.
Tristan: Oh, man, 'freaky fish guy' really knows  how to cook! Hmm-hmm!.
Téa (to Yugi): Really good, huh?.
Yugi (to Téa): Mmmm-hmm!.
Mako (think): Heheheh!.
Joey: (burp) Wow, that was good!.
Téa: Where'd you learn to cook like that?.
Mako: Hahaha! I've had to fend for myself since I was a tadpole. But it was my father who taught me how to fish and cook. .
Yugi (innocently): So-o-o, what brings *you* here to the competition?.
Mako: I was raised on a fishing boat, where I learned to love the sea, so if I win *here*, I would love a vessel of my own. Of course, I'll have to beat a few duelists first. Hahahahaha!.
Téa: Your own boat? How great would that be, living life out on the big blue sea!.
Mako (with feeling): Yes, the ocean is amazing, and we have shared a special bond since I was born. I can tell when the sea is happy by the way it sparkles, *and* when it is angry, by the shifting tides... (he scratches the back of his head, a bit sheepish at his passionate speech) Ehaha, excuse me, I didn't mean to be so serious..
Téa: Oh no, don't apologize!.
Joey: You saved our hides! We'd be starvin' without you! This's really been great; thanks again! .
Mako: Leaving so soon, are you...?.
Téa: Nice meeting you, Mako! .
Yugi: Maybe we'll meet up in the competition..
Mako: We *certainly will*... sooner than you think, my friend! .
Yugi: Huh?.
Yugi: Guhhh!.
Mako: Ahuhuhuhuh. I treated *you* to dinner; perhaps you will... honor *me* with a duel..
Joey: He's nuts!.
Mako: No, but I *am* an expert fisherman. And *you* have taken my bait! Ahahahahaha!.
Téa: *What* bait?.
Mako: Why, the fish, of course! I laid it out and lured *you three* right in! But I *never* expected to catch Yugi Muto! .
Joey: Aahh, forget this crazy chicken-a'-the-sea, Yugi. .
Tristan: Can't we just give the guy back a few fish?.
Mako: I reeled in another duelist a short time ago, but he was not a worthy opponent. But a duel against *you*, Yugi, would be a true test!.
Yugi: Yu-Gi-Oh...!! .
Yugi (Yami): Mako Tsunami, I accept your challenge!.
Mako: Behold, Yugi Muto! We shall battle beside the majestic sea! .
Mako: The playing field is equally split into two halves; one half is land, the other is sea. .
Yugi (Yami): And the stakes, Mako?.
Mako: I wager two star chips on this match..
Yugi (Yami): Two stars..
Mako (think): Finally, an adversary of real merit! How I have *waited* for this day! (aloud) Now, let the battle begin!.
Yugi (Yami) and Mako: Duel!.
Téa: This should be *some* match! .
Joey: Sink that soggy sucker, Yugi!.
Mako: I'm curious to see, how you will combat my mighty denizens of the deep!.
Yugi (Yami): What's this? His creature is underwater! How do I choose which card to play, when I can't even see what I'm fighting!.
Joey: This I don't like..
Mako: The ocean conceals many things beneath its shifting surface..
Yugi (Yami): Rrgh! As long as that *thing* stays submerged, I can't attack! .
Mako: I promise he won't stay *submerged* for very long!.
Yugi (think): I have no *idea* what that thing is down there. So I better prepare for the worst, with as strong a defense as possible! .
Mako (think): Hm! Clearly this is Yugi's first encounter with sea-based duel monsters. He will learn firsthand what a powerful ally the sea can be! It gives my creatures a field power bonus, and it *conceals* them, making their stealthy attacks even more lethal!.
Joey: Somethin's fishy! How can he fight what he can't see?!.
Téa: Beats *me*..
Tristan: This is totally bogus!.
Mako: Ahahahaha! It seems that my ocean-based strategy has taken you by surprise, Yugi!.
Yugi (think): Maybe so-- but I can still raise a strong defense! (aloud, Yami) I call upon the Horn Imp!.
Horn Imp 1300/1000/L4/dark.
Mako: Now, Fiend Kraken! Ensnare him!.
Yug (Yami): My Imp!.
Fiend Kraken 1200/1400/L4/water.
Yugi (Yami): Attack!.
Joey and Tristan: Ugh!.
Téa: What is *that*?.
Joey (VO): Whatever it is, it's *bad news* for Yugi!.
Joey (VO): Aw, man-- Yugi's Imp is done-for!.
Mako: Fiend Kraken, end this now!.
Mako: Well done, Kraken!.
Yugi (Yami): Ugh....
Téa: Wow, and that was just his opening move!.
Yugi (Yami): Ugh! You're good, Mako; a brilliant opening play..
Mako: I am pleased you appreciate it! Though I very much doubt your Imp did..
Yugi (Yami, mutters): Well, now I know what I'm up against..
Mako: Yes, the mighty ocean commands respect, as do the *creatures* that inhabit it!.
Yugi (think): Maybe I can prepare an attack, that will *destroy* his creatures, even though I can't see them. (aloud, Yami) Feral Imp!.
Feral Imp 1300/1400/L4/dark.
Yugi (think): My Feral Imp should dispense with Mako's monsters, no matter how deep they're hidden in the sea. .
Mako: I am familiar with your feral monster-- *and* its electrical attack! So for my next card, I play-- my giant Jellyfish!.
Jellyfish 1200///water.
Mako: Hahahaha, behold!.
Yugi (Yami): Ah! I don't like the sound of *that*!.
Mako: Hahahaha! *That* is the battle cry of my creature!.
Yugi (Yami): It'll be *crying* all right, once I combine my Feral Imp with the magical "Horn of the Unicorn"! .
Joey: All right!.
Téa: What?.
Joey: Yugi can't see Mako's monsters, but he *knows* they're all underwater, and *water conducts electricity!*.
Téa: Oh... so they're vulnerable to the Feral Imp's electrical attack! (gasp) Whoa, that is *so smart*!!.
Yugi (Yami): Magic Lightning-- attack!!.
Joey: 'S a fish-fry!!.
Yugi (Yami) But wait-- what is *this*? Nothing's happening, Mako still has all his lifepoints! .
Mako: Ahahaha! Your strategy has failed, Yugi! .
Yugi (Yami): How?!.
Mako: As a sea duelist, I am well aware that water conducts electricity; so I played my giant Jellyfish! It has the magical ability to absorb *all* electrical attacks, protecting *all of my  ocean creatures*! .
Yugi (Yami): Rrrgh! .
Mako: And now it's time for my counterattack! Fiend Kraken, crush his Feral Imp! .
Mako: Crush him, now!.
Mako: Ahahaha! Did you enjoy my Kraken's embrace? Hahahahaha!.
Yugi (think): I've *never* dueled against creatures like *these* before! It feels as if I'm battling Mako's sea monsters, and the awesome power of the ocean *itself*! .
Mako: Do *any* of your cards have the power to stand against my ocean pets?.
Yugi (Yami): I have the power of Silver Fang..
Silver Fang 1200/800/L3/earth.
Yugi (Yami): And I combine him with the magic of the Full Moon (sic), to double his ferocity!.
Mako: Ahahahahaha! Ferocious, indeed! But the moon also controls the tides, causing them to rise. Allowing *me* to unleash my next creature!  Arise, mighty Kairyu-Shin!.
Yugi (Yami): Rrgh! What's this?!.
Joey: Whoa, that is *one big fish*!!.
Mako: Behold the colossal Kairyu-Shin, a creature so enormous, that when he rises up from the ocean depths, he creates his own tidal wave!.
Yugi (Yami): What a beast! .
Mako: Your wolf is brave, Yugi, but he will not stand before my Kairyu-Shin's Tidal Attack! .
Yugi (Yami): No! Silver Fang!.
Mako: Gone. But my Kairyu-Shin's Tidal Attack did more than simply wash your wolf cub away. .
Yugi (Yami): What?!.
Mako: It *considerably altered* our playing field..
Yugi (Yami): Ah...! My land!.
Yugi (Yami): Kairyu-Shin's attack has nearly washed away my entire land-based playing field! .
Mako: Ahahaha. You should consider yourself *lucky*, Yugi. In my previous duels, when Kairyu-Shin attacks, absolutely *nothing* is left standing in its wake.  I think it was quite *considerate* of my pet to leave you a little patch of *dirt* to stand on! Don't *you*? (Yugi isn't much consoled) ... Or does it make you uneasy to be surrounded on all sides by the sea...? (Mako is deadly serious) All men give pause before the savage power of the mighty ocean. Even the greatest of fishermen..
Yugi (Yami): You mean your father....
Mako: My father was a great fisherman. He taught me my love of the sea. But... one day the sea... took him....
Mako (VO): I loved going out on the boat with my father -- Just the two of us, and the big, beautiful ocean! -- never suspecting that the sea would turn on us..
FlashBack Mako's dad: Look, Mako! There's a storm blowing in. .
FlashBack Young Mako (fearful): A big one?.
FlashBack Mako's dad: Maybe. I've learned to never take chances with the sea..
FlashBack Young Mako: Oh..
Mako (VO): And father was right! Suddenly the calm, friendly sea turned into a raging maelstrom! It pitched our boat as if it were a toy..
FlashBack Young Mako: Ahh, father, I can't hold on!.
FlashBack Mako's dad: It's okay, Mako. There-- I've tied you down. You'll be safe here, son, I promise. .
FlashBack Young Mako: Dad, look out!!.
(Tableau. The huge tidal wave towered over the tiny boat.) .
FlashBack Young Mako and Mako's dad: Who-o-o-a-a-a!!.
Mako: When the storm finally died out, our little boat had washed ashore..
Mako: My father was right, *I* had been perfectly safe-- (despairing) but because he had stopped to tie me down, he had no time to secure himself to the mast! I thought I had lost him forever-- but then I noticed that our lifeboat was missing!.
Mako: I *know* my father is alive! So I will win this contest, buy a ship, and search the seven seas until I find him! *That* is why I duel, Yugi, *that* is why *I* must *win*, and *you* must *lose*!.
Yugi (Yami): I understand, Mako, *believe* me; but I still can't let you win..
Mako: Ha!.
Téa: Oh, wow..
Joey: Mako duels for his dad like Yugi duels for his grandpa..
Tristan: Whoa-- this is too intense!.
Yugi (think): With so little land left to me, I've really gotta make this next play count. I need something that will help me turn the tide. Something like  this card. (aloud, Yami) Giant Soldier of Stone!.
Giant Soldier of Stone 1300/2000/L3/earth.
Yugi (Yami): You may've shrunk my battlefield down to an island, Mako, but my stone soldier still gets a field power bonus!.
Mako: Your massive monster can barely *fit* on that little rock, let alone do battle with my undersea attack force! .
Yugi (Yami): Mmm..
Mako: And he is surrounded on all sides by the ocean, making him easy prey for-- Great White Terror!.
Great White Terror 1600/1200/L4/water.
Mako: This savage shark will lead my other sea creatures in an all-out ocean onslaught!.
Joey: Man, Yugi's guy is outnumbered three-to-one!.
Joey (VO): His Stone Soldier's about to become fish-food!.
Mako: This is it, Yugi. It's over-- but you played honorably..
Yugi (Yami): You have been a fair and noble opponent too, Mako, but I, also, duel with the fate of a loved one at stake..
Yugi (Yami): And I can't afford to lose. I switch my Stone Soldier to attack mode! .
Mako: Attack mode...? But why?! He cannot attack my sea monsters while they're underwater! .
Yugi (Yami): But his target isn't your *sea monsters*. I'm having him attack a card I put on the field myself--.
Yugi (Yami): The moon!.
Mako: No!!.
Yugi (Yami): Now, Stone Soldier! Destroy the moon!.
Mako: Ugh!!.
Mako: What's happening?! The tide! It's going out! But *how*?!.
Yugi (Yami): As you yourself said before, Mako, it is the *moon* that controls the ocean's tides-- its ebb *and* its flow. So I ordered my Stone Soldier to obliterate the moon, causing  the ocean's tides to reverse and recede..
Mako: Rrrrgh!!.
Yugi (Yami): My Stone Soldier has beached *all* your sea monsters; you have no ocean left!.
Mako: No- my- precious- fish!.
Yugi (Yami): And now I'll deliver the final blow. I combine my Curse of Dragon card with the magic of the "Burning Land" card, to wipe out your remaining lifepoints!.
Curse of Dragon 2000/1500/L5/dark.
Yugi (Yami): Burning Land Attack!.
Yugi (Yami): And that takes your lifepoints down to zero..
Mako: Rrrrgh-- aaaah, no!!!.
Téa: Hahaha! Way to go, Yugi!.
Joey and Tristan: Yeah!!.
Mako (humbled): Destroying your own moon card was a brilliant and unexpected move, Yugi. (he sighs, then regains his characteristic grin.) Ahaha! What a grand duel! I salute you, my friend! .
Yugi (Yami): This victory was not easily won, Mako. You're a great duelist yourself!.
Mako: Ha! .
Mako: I am down to one star chip-- but I will start over again! .
Yugi (Yami): And I bet you'll do fine..
Mako: You'd win *that* wager! Ha!.
Téa: You know, I can't help but like that Mako. He's such a great guy and all. I hope he finds his father someday. .
Joey: Mmm-hmm..
Mako: Ahahaha! My friend, dueling you is hungry work!.
Mako: Time for Mako to fish again! Farewell...!!.
Téa: 'Bye, Mako....
Tristan (wistful): Wish he'd bring us some fish....
Yugi (Yami, joking): We'd have to duel him again....
Joey: Forget about it! But guys, I *am* getting *seriously* hungry..
Tristan: Not a problem! We've still got my Great Outdoor Survival Guide!.
Téa (laughing): No *way*!.
Joey: G'head, Tristan, eat all the pages you like!.
Mokuba: Huh?.
Mokuba: Ohh....
Mokuba: Whoa-a-a-a-a!.
Croquet: A'right, ya little runt. Here's your daily gruel, heheh. .
Croquet: Huh?! Oh, no! .
Croquet: He's gone!.
Pegasus: Mmmhahahahahahaha...! Ahahahahahahahah!.
Pegasus: Hmhmhmhmhahahahaha! Where do these guys get all their ideas? .
Pegasus: Mmmhmhmhmhmhm--.
Croquet: Euh, Master Pegasus?.
Pegasus: Hm?!.
Croquet: A thousand pardons, sir. .
Pegasus: Gorgonzola cheese, and the world's finest fruit juice-- along with a copy of my favorite comic book! Times like this are more precious to me than *any other*, you do *realize that*, *don't* you?!.
Croquet (gulp): But the prisoner has escaped..
Pegasus (casually): Which one?.
Croquet: The boy we imprisoned in the north tower. I have our men searching the island, but, so far there's no sign of him. .
Pegasus: Oooh. I guess he didn't *appreciate* my hospitality. Well, no matter, I'm sure I know exactly where our little escapee is heading. He'll seek out Yugi. .
Pegasus: Computer.  Request data on the status of the Duel Monsters tournament..
Computer: Six hours have passed since the dueling contests began..
Computer: Twelve of the participants have been eliminated. Those that were defeated and lost their star chips are being removed from the island by boat. .
Pegasus: And what of *Yugi Muto*?.
Computer: Yugi Muto has to date gained *five* star chips. .
Pegasus: *Wonderful*. I expected no less. He is determined to work his way up in the standings in order to gain entry to my castle. Which is *exactly* what I want little Yugi to do. We'll just *keep* our spy-cams trained on our star duelist; sooner or later, the little runaway prisoner will confront Yugi, for reasons of his own..
Croquet: Hm! *Very wise*, sir..
Pegasus: *Actually* the boy's escape plays right into my plans. And I *do* have such special plans in store for Yugi today-- plans I hope he'll find as *entertaining* as I do! Hahahahahahaha!.
Téa: Wow, Yugi! I can't believe  you already won five star chips! .
Tristan: Yeah; pretty soon you'll have the ten you need to get into Pegasus' castle, and rescue your grandpa!.
Joey: I wish *I* had more star chips. .
Yugi: Don't worry about it, Joey, you're doin' fine. You'll be able to help your sister out soon..
Joey: I sure hope so....
Joey (VO): Serenity's really countin' on me..
Joey: An' I won't let 'er down. .
- He-e-e-e-elp!!.
Tristan: What's that?!.
- Help me, somebody, please!.
- Aaaagghhh, let go of me, somebody help me!!.
Tristan: Hold on, kid, we're comin'!!.
- Help, you gotta help me!!.
Tristan: Let that kid go!.
- Help! Help me please!.
Tristan: I'm on the big guy! .
Tristan: Not too shabby..
Tristan: Ugh... I'm *off* the big guy....
Kid: Put me down!.
Kemo: Quit squirming, ya little brat!.
Joey: *You* heard 'im, needle-head! Put the kid down! .
Yugi: What d'you think you're doin'? .
Kemo: This is none of your business. This duelist lost his star chips. And the rules say he's to be kicked off the island!.
Kid: But I didn't lose my chips in a duel, they were *stolen* from me! My cards, too!.
Kemo: I don't care *what* lame excuse you have, kid, you need star chips to duel and you haven't *got* any, so you're shippin' outta here! Those're the rules; those are my orders from Pegasus himself. .
Tristan: Ugh, that big creep! I say we follow 'im!.
- Hey Kemo, what'd'ja catch? .
Kemo: Just another *loser*. Haha!.
Weevil: Hey, buzz off! They may be shipping me out, but I'm still Weevil Underwood, bug duelist extraordinaire!.
Kid: But *I* didn't even get a chance to *duel*....
Yugi: Hey!.
Yugi: Hey, you!.
Kemo: *You* again?!.
Yugi: What did the guy who stole your star chips look like?.
Kid: Well, I couldn't see his face-- i-it was covered with a bandanna. But he was a little guy, and he challenged me in the meadow. .
Yugi: He challenged you to a Duel Monsters game? .
Kid: Yeah. But as soon as I put my star chips and Duel Monsters deck down, he snatched 'em up and ran off with them! .
Yugi: You shouldn't be shipped off the island for *that*! *We'll* get your star chips back..
Kemo: This boat leaves in exactly thirty minutes. Anyone without a star chip ships out..
Téa: Then we'll get his chips back by that time..
Tristan: We won't let you bully him out of the game!.
Joey: Nope! We'll catch that little thief and bring 'im to justice! Believe me, kid, you can count on us to track 'im down and get those star chips back!.
Kid: But who *are* you guys?.
Joey: We're the guys that're gonna save your chips! Don' worry, ya got the ba-rilliant mind a' Joey Wheeler on the case, and I *always* get my man..
Yugi, Téa, Tristan (here he goes again): Ugh....
Joey: Even if he's just a kid. Onward, troops!.
Tristan: *So* what's you're ba-rilliant mind tellin' ya *now*, Sherlock?.
Joey: Beats *me*. Right now, the only thing my brilliant mind is doin' is givin' me a brilliant *headache*!.
Yugi: Well, maybe we should stake out the scene of the crime. It's over there!.
Joey: Think the thief'll come back? .
Yugi: He just might, and we can put our heads together and plan in the meantime..
Tristan: Yeah, but don't forget one of those heads is Joey's. That's sorta like *subtractin' one brain*! .
Joey: Ha, ha..
Mokuba: Ahh- ha!! I've found you at last, Yugi!!.
Joey: That must be the kid we were looking for!.
Tristan: I can handle 'im!.
Téa: I *hope* so, you're twice his size!.
Mokuba: Just try me, ya big dork!!.
Tristan: Back off, kid!.
Joey: And hand over the star chips you swiped from that other duelist!!.
Yugi: Hold on. I think I know what this kid's after. He wants to duel..
Joey and Tristan: Huh?.
Yugi (to the kid): That's what you want, right? You wanna duel me?.
Mokuba: Aww, you better believe it!.
Joey: I don't get it. Why is Yugi goin' to the trouble a' duelin' this guy, when we can just *take* those star chips away from 'im?.
Tristan: Y'know sometimes I don't think even *Yugi* knows why he does half the stuff he does. .
Joey: Huh. Yeah, it's kinda weird. D'ya think it has something to do with his Millennium Puzzle?.
Yugi: Yu-Gi-Oh...!! .
Yugi (Yami): Now, how many star chips will you wager?.
Mokuba: To wipe you out? Five!.
Yugi (Yami): Then five it is; but only because I think I know why you're doing this. .
Mokuba: I don't care what *you* think, Yugi, 'cause *I* think *you're* gonna lose!.
Téa: What does Yugi see that we *don't*? It's like he's looking into the other player's *soul*..
Joey: Hey-- soul, shmoll. I can see from here that that kid's gonna get his butt kicked!.
Tristan: Maybe, but Yugi should hurry if he plans to get those star chips back to the boat in time! .
Téa: Don't worry, Tristan. He'll win the chips, and we'll be back at the dock with time to spare..
Yugi(Yami) and Mokuba: Duel!.
Mokuba (think): This is *it*, Yugi. Now you're gonna pay for what you did to *my big brother*....
FlashBack Mokuba: Seto, ya gotta leave now if you're gonna make the boat for the big tournament at Duelist Kingdom. *Seto*, open the door!.
FlashBack Mokuba: Huh? Seto? .
FlashBack Kaiba: I'm not going, Mokuba..
FlashBack Mokuba: Not *going*? Why not?.
FlashBack Kaiba: There's no point! .
FlashBack Mokuba: Whaddaya *mean*, "no point"?.
FlashBack Kaiba: Kid, I am in no condition to duel anyone..
FlashBack Mokuba: Whadd'reyou *talking* about? You always say, 'cards're power' and you've got all the strongest cards!.
FlashBack Kaiba: Since I lost my duel with Yugi, I just don't know *what* I think anymore. Everything's different, it feels as if I lost a piece of *myself* that day!.
FlashBack Mokuba: But Seto, you're the best. You're the champ..
FlashBack Kaiba: Not since the day I was defeated by Yugi..
FlashBack Mokuba: Huh?.
FlashBack Kaiba: Here, Mokuba. I'm going away for a while; I don't know how long I'll be gone. Keep this; it was always your favorite..
FlashBack Mokuba: Why? Why're you leaving?.
FlashBack Kaiba: Because I don't know who I am anymore. Take care, kid. .
FlashBack Mokuba: Seto, don't go!!.
FlashBack Mokuba: Uh....
Mokuba (VO): You broke up my family, Yugi....
Mokuba (think): ...And now, I'm gonna break *you* up! (aloud) My first card is the Man-Eating Plant!.
Man-Eating Plant 800/// .
Yugi (Yami): Now it's my turn! I'll counter your attack, with the Winged Dragon, Guardian of the Fortress!.
Winged Dragon, Guardian of the Fortress #1 1400/1200/L4/wind.
Mokuba: Ha! Bad choice, Yugi! My Man-Eating Plant will eat your Dragon *alive*!.
Mokuba: So now you're finally gonna pay for what you did, Yugi-- and your stupid dragon's gonna be plant food! Man-Eating Plant, attack!.
Yugi (Yami): Fireball Attack!.
Mokuba: Huh? My monster *lost*?.
Yugi (Yami): You can't win a duel with cards that don't rightfully belong to you. How could *your* heart ever live in cards that belong to someone else? .
Mokuba: Be quiet. I don't believe in that *Heart of the Cards* stuff you keep preachin' about. Cards have nothin' to *do* with heart-- it's all about *power*!.
Yugi (Yami, murmurs): Yes, I can see it now..
Yugi (Yami): I *sensed* a connection to Kaiba!  You're his *brother*-- you're *Mokuba!*.
Mokuba: How did you know?! (pulls down the bandanna) Well, it doesn't matter!.
Joey: Look!.
Téa: It *is* Kaiba's little brother!.
Mokuba: That's right; Seto Kaiba is my brother, and he's the best duelist that there ever *was*. (throws away the hat) But now, thanks to Yugi, he's gone; and Pegasus is trying to take over KaibaCorp!.
Yugi (Yami): *Pegasus* wants *KaibaCorp*?!.
Mokuba: I dunno what you did to my big brother when you dueled, Yugi, but ever since that defeat, he hasn't been the same....
Mokuba (VO): He ran away 'cause of you! And with him gone, Pegasus moved right in. Some KaibaCorp executives invited 'im to some kinda secret board meeting. .
FlashBack Pegasus: Now gentlemen, let's see if I understand your proposition. Seto Kaiba has abandoned his corporate station and now *you five* wish to seize control of KaibaCorp.You *then* want to merge with *my* company, and you'd like me to handle any *messy details*, yes?.
FlashBack Big Five: Precisely, Mister Pegasus. With our money and your leadership, we would *easily* take control of KaibaCorp. .
FlashBack Pegasus: Do tell. .
FlashBack Big Five: For our plan to succeed, Kaiba must be taken out of the picture-- permanently..
FlashBack Big Five: However, there is one catch. As per the corporate bylaws, only a Kaiba family member can legally control KaibaCorp. .
FlashBack Pegasus: Hmm..
FlashBack Big Five: To that end, Pegasus, we recommend kidnapping Kaiba's brother Mokuba. In *name* he will control KaibaCorp, but *we* will control *him*. .
FlashBack Big Five: Do these things for us, and we will lay all of KaibaCorp's technology at your feet. .
FlashBack Pegasus: Agreed. The elder Kaiba shall meet with an... accident... and the younger Kaiba will be captured. .
FlashBack Big Five: Excellent. But we have one final condition..
FlashBack Big Five: The brat who beat Kaiba has tarnished KaibaCorp's good name..
FlashBack Big Five: And we must insist that you restore it. .
FlashBack Pegasus: *Well*, how fortuitous. Plans for me to duel Yugi are already underway..
FlashBack Pegasus: Now-- to show that I truly *am* the man for this job....
FlashBack Pegasus: Kemo, bring me young Kaiba, would you?.
FlashBack Mokuba: No-o-o!!.
FlashBack Mokuba: Ugh- ah- lemme go, you creeps! I heard everything and when I tell *my big brother* you're gonna be--.
FlashBack Pegasus: You see, gentlemen? *This* is how efficiently  you can expect me to handle our business. Young Kaiba is captured, Yugi will be defeated, and Seto Kaiba will bother us no more, hahahahahaha!.
Mokuba: Ugh... It's all your fault; Seto *deserted* me 'cause a you! .
Yugi (Yami): You don't understand. Mokuba, your brother *hasn't deserted you*; he's searching for himself. .
Mokuba: Liar! Tell it to my monster!.
Krokodilus 1200/// .
Mokuba: Go, Krokodilus!.
Yugi (Yami): Battling *me* won't bring your brother back. And we want to stop Pegasus as much as you do! He's taken my grandfather prisoner..
Joey: That's right, *Pegasus* is the bad guy here! Can'tcha see that, ya crazy little kid?!.
Mokuba: You're wrong! I have to protect my brother's company, and Yugi's the one Pegasus has to beat in order to take it over!.
Téa: Wait; I get it. Mokuba is trying to save his brother's company by defeating Yugi in a duel--  so *Pegasus* doesn't get to face Yugi at all!.
Tristan: Whaddaya mean?.
Joey: Whaddaya *mean* 'what do I mean'?!.
Tristan: I wasn't talking to *you*!.
Joey: Sorry, what did *you* mean, Téa?.
Téa: If Mokuba can keep Pegasus from beating Yugi, he won't be able to take over Kaiba's company..
Yugi (Yami): Ah, that must be it! .
Yugi (Yami): Hey-- where'd he go?.
Mokuba: If I can't beat you-- aagh!-- I'll have you disqualified!.
Yugi (Yami): My star chips!.
Tristan: Hold up, ya little punk!.
Yugi (Yami): Mokuba, *listen to me*! You'll *never* save Kaiba Corporation that way!.
Yugi (Yami): Your big brother is just *confused.* After I defeated Kaiba in our duel, I opened his mind. I removed from him all the dark influences that clouded his thoughts and actions. Free of that evil essence, Kaiba is *struggling*. Now your brother realizes that his way wasn't the right way, and he's searching his heart for *answers*. And you know in your heart what you're doing isn't the right way either. .
Mokuba: But then... what can I *do*?.
Yugi (Yami): You can start by trusting in *me*,  and together-- *we will* defeat Pegasus! I promise you, we can only bring Pegasus down if we stick together. We'll help you protect your brother, Mokuba, but you've got to help us, okay? You've got to go back and return those cards *and star chips* to the kid you stole them from. .
Mokuba: You're right, Yugi. Then we'll take on Pegasus together!.
Téa: We've only got three minutes left 'til the boat leaves!.
Yugi (Yami): Let's get going, Mokuba!.
Mokuba: Let's do it!.
Kaiba (think): Agh! It's no use! I've gone over it a dozen times in my mind, but I still can't figure it out..
Kaiba (think): How was a kid who came out of *nowhere,* able to defeat a champion like *me*? I've run computer simulations, probability scenarios, and quantum analysis of our duel, but I *still* don't have the answer!.
Kaiba (VO, think): I had clearly been dominating the match; my Blue-Eyes White Dragon ripped through his forces! I was on the verge of winning! But Yugi wouldn't give up. .
Kaiba (VO, think): Against all odds and  with absolute faith in his grandfather's deck, he somehow drew the one card that assured his victory!.
FlashBack Kaiba: Exodia! It's not possible!.
FlashBack Yugi (Yami): Exodia... *Obliterate*!!!.
FlashBack Kaiba: Uuaaggh...!!.
Kaiba (think): I've always believed Duel Monsters was a game of sheer power; but *Yugi* claims that the cards have a heart!.
Kaiba (think): It sounds crazy, I know; but could Yugi be *right*? Is there really a Heart of the Cards that can affect the outcome of a duel? Is that how he won? The only way I'll know for sure is to face Yugi again-- and these new portable holo-generators will enable me to challenge him no matter *where* I find 'im! If I can just get to-- hmm?.
- Seto Kaiba! We know you're in there! Open the door or we'll break it down!.
- Let's go, Kaiba. .
- On ya feet! .
- Mista' Pegasus would like to have a few words wit'cha. .
Kaiba: Hmph.  I bet he *would*, but it'll take more than you two goons to grab *me*. .
- This can go easy, or we can snap ya in two, wiseguy!.
Kaiba: You'll never take me alive!.
- Get 'im!.
- He jumped! ...*Nobody* could survive a fall like *that*. .
- Looks like *he* did our work *for* us! .
- Yeah, that just leaves the rest a' the job. Pegasus was very clear, he wants the deck wit' the deadly Blue-Eyes White Dragon..
Téa: Hurry, we're almost there!.
Tristan: We're gonna *just make it*!.
Yugi (Yami): What?!.
Weevil: I told you I'm not gonna row, so *quit bugging me*!!!.
Mokuba: The boat! It's already left!.
Joey: And there's the sleazy lowlife that shipped 'em out!.
Kemo: You're too late, those losers are on their way back home..
Téa: Hey; that's not fair, it hasn't been a half-hour yet!.
Kemo: Tough luck; *Pegasus* sets the schedule here!.
Joey: *That's* it, I'm gonna give you a *flat* top!.
Mokuba: You've gotta call the boat back,  I've gotta return that kid's star chips to him!.
Mokuba: Ahh--!.
Yugi (Yami): The star chips!!.
Joey, Tristan, Téa: Ahhh!!.
Joey: What gives?! A buncha those star chips belonged to *Yugi,* ya big jerk!.
Mokuba: I am *so sorry*, Yugi..
Kemo: Ha! You *losers* should keep a tighter grip on your valuables, don'tcha think? Then *accidents* like that wouldn't happen! Now....
Kemo: Let's go, you; back to the cage! This little *ingrate* is a special guest of Mister Maximillion Pegasus, and he's been invited to attend a special dinner in his honor *back at the castle*. *Right*, Mokuba?.
Mokuba: Yugi--!.
Yugi (Yami): Hold on!.
Kemo: Hmm?.
Yugi (Yami): I still have *three* of my star chips left. (points, declaring) I challenge you to a duel, and if I win, Mokuba comes with us! .
Kemo: Hmph. I don't know why you'd risk your chips for this punk; but if that's how you wanna waste your last star chips, then meet me back at Arena One-Forty-Six in exactly four hours; you'll have your duel..
Joey: Well, we're here. Where's *antenna-head*? .
Mokuba: Yugi-! Over here!.
Mokuba: Get'im- off me!.
Yugi (Yami): Mokuba! *Put him down*, now!.
Kemo: I'll consider it, *if* you win the duel..
Yugi (Yami): Oh, I'll *beat you*, all right....
Kemo: I never said *I* would duel. *There* is your opponent!.
Kemo: He's an old friend who's *dying* to see you again! He met with an unfortunate *end* earlier today, but, he's come back *just to duel you*. .
Mokuba (panicked): What're you saying?!.
Yugi (Yami): *Kaiba*...!.
Ghost Kaiba: Mmmhm, yes, Yugi. It's me, Kaiba. And this time you don't stand... a *ghost* of a chance! Hnhnhnhnhnhnhn....
Kemo: Huhuhuh! Yugi, you don't have a ghost of a chance beating Kaiba, because this time, he *is* a ghost!.
Yugi (Yami): A ghost?!.
Mokuba: Stop it, Kemo!.
Kemo: It's a fact; two witnesses saw him fall to his doom..
Mokuba: Liar! Take back what you said!.
Kemo: Get used to it; all that's left of Kaiba are your memories. Plus a very cranky ghost just lookin' for revenge! .
Yugi (Yami): 'S not him!.
Kemo: Well, he's seen better days.  It's time to duel, with the ghoul!.
Yugi (Yami): It *can't* be! That guy's nothing but a fake, a trick by Pegasus! Don't worry, Mokuba; I'll win your freedom....
Yugi (Yami, via videoscreen): ... Then we'll find your brother..
Pegasus: Hahahahaha! This is extremely entertaining! I just *love* reality TV..
Croquet (curious): Who *is* Yugi dueling?.
Pegasus: It's *Kaiba*, what's left of him. The poor boy had shown *so* much promise..
Croquet: But now he's... it's... heah, how did you *do* that?.
Pegasus: I really can't take *all* the credit. I had help from Yugi. And now to *return* the favor....
Pegasus (VO): ...I'm going to teach him a lesson, about the *real* power of the Millennium Items!.
Ghost Kaiba: Yugi, you look like you've seen a ghost..
Yugi (Yami): That's enough!.
Ghost Kaiba: I am no longer of this world, and it's *all* because of *you*!.
Yugi (Yami): Mrrgh!.
Ghost Kaiba: I could have had it all, but when you beat me, you took more than just the match. You stole my life and destroyed my soul. .
Yugi (Yami): You're nothing but an impostor, so stop the lies and let's start the duel..
Ghost Kaiba: Fine with me. *This* time you won't beat my cards..
Yugi (Yami): You might *look* like Kaiba, but there is no way you can imitate his *deck*..
Ghost Kaiba: You mean *my* deck..
Yugi (Yami): Grr....
Mokuba: Beat him, Yugi! He's nothing but a fake!.
Joey: Yeah, that ghost don't even *look* like Kaiba!.
Téa: That's right! Wait, I mean, it's not a ghost and it's not Kaiba!.
Tristan: Get 'im, Yugi!.
Yugi (Yami): Hm!.
Ghost Kaiba (think): Yugi..
Ghost Kaiba (think): I know you can hear me. I know you can sense my thoughts, and I know that you can see the truth-- .
Ghost Kaiba (think): I *am* Kaiba, but this time you're dueling someone who's got nothing to lose! (aloud) Kemo, once I beat Yugi, Pegasus can have Kaiba Corporation; all I want is revenge! Three stars says I win..
Yugi (Yami): Fine by me, that means when the duel's done I'll have six!.
Ghost Kaiba: Let's duel. .
(And the duel is on.) .
Ghost Kaiba: Guess I'll go first. Huh! And I'll start off with the Hitotsu-Me Giant! .
Hitotsu-Me Giant 1200/1000/L3/earth.
Ghost Kaiba: Hm, is something wrong? It's your turn to move, Yugi..
Yugi (think): The Hitotsu-Me Giant... is how Kaiba began our last duel..
Mokuba: There's a card just like that in my brother's deck....
Joey: Hey, just 'cause it's the same card doesn't mean it's the same deck!.
Yugi (think): He's trying to confuse me by making the same opening move that Kaiba did; but it'll have the same result! (aloud) I'll start with this card-- go, Dark Magician! With an attack strength of twenty-five hundred! .
Dark Magician 2500/2100/L7/dark.
Yugi (Yami): Dark Magic Attack! .
Yugi (Yami): So much for your giant. .
Ghost Kaiba: Hmhmhm, you're as strong as ever, Yugi. Huhuhuhuh!.
Joey: Did you see that?! That carbon-copy Kaiba's laughin'!.
Ghost Kaiba: It's funny how things have come full-circle, Yugi. What are you thinking in that feeble brain of yours right now? I bet I know; you've come to the conclusion that, no matter what, there's no way you can win, and you couldn't be more right. Even a simpleton like you now knows that I *must* be Seto Kaiba, and once you accept that fact you may as well accept defeat!.
Yugi (Yami): I don't care *who* you are, you're going to lose to *me* just the same..
Ghost Kaiba: But Yugi, you barely beat me the last time we dueled, and this time your big advantage is-- gone..
Yugi (Yami): *What do you mean?*.
Ghost Kaiba: Hmhmhmhmhmhm. Exodia. You've lost Exodia. (Yugi gasps) You can only beat me with Exodia in your deck, and without it, you can only lose!.
Disappear.
Outta here.
It was time to pay my dues.
Never guess.
That you'd be dressed.
In my clothes and in my shoes!.
- Get 'im!.
- Nobody could survive a fall like that!.
You couldn't wait to move right in.
If I were you, I'd be concerned.
Ain't no way you're gonna win.
Betcha didn't count on my return!.
Thought you were so tough,.
You had it all under control,.
Now enough is enough!.
Gonna take back what you stole!.
Give it up, 'cause now I'm back..
Give it up, 'cause now I'm back..
Computer: Running identity verification protocol. Please state your name..
Kaiba: Seto Kaiba..
Computer: I thought I'd seen it all, but having to break into your own house?.
Kaiba: It's too long a story for right now..
Computer: Too long a story! Well maybe *I'm* not in such a talkative mood *myself* right now!.
Kaiba: I'd find that hard to believe..
Computer: Such a smart guy. While *you* were off gallivantin', a hostile takeover of Kaiba Corporation has begun..
Kaiba: I know..
Computer: At the same time, Maximillion Pegasus kicked off his Duel Monsters championship at the Duelist Kingdom. If Yugi Muto (picture of him appears onscreen)  can be defeated by Pegasus, or a competitor that represents him, (close in on the picture of Pegasus) then the new Kaiba Corporation board has promised him control of the company!.
Kaiba: He won't win. Yugi is unbeatable; his deck has Exodia....
FlashBack Yugi (Yami): Exodia... *Obliterate*!!.
FlashBack Kaiba: Uuuagh!.
Computer: Yeah, well, sometime after *you* lost to *Yugi*, *he* lost Exodia!.
Kaiba: No way! Unggh...!.
Computer: When it rains, it *pours*. (An image of Mokuba appears next to the picture of Pegasus) Pegasus *knows* all about the corporation bylaws that require a living Kaiba heir to make any change of control *legal*; Mokuba's his prisoner! .
Computer (VO): And with *you* out of the way, it's likely Pegasus will exert all *kinds* of pressure to make your brother do what he wants; one way, or another. .
Computer: So, now ya know. What're we gonna do?!.
Kaiba: They'll keep my brother safe, at least until the takeover's complete. So I've gotta make sure that Pegasus doesn't defeat Yugi in a duel; no matter what.  I'm not gonna give up Kaiba Corporation without a real fight; it's takeover time, by *me*. We're going to hack right into Pegasus' computer mainframe. Next stop-- the Duelist Kingdom..
Yugi (Yami): Are you here to play head games, or Duel Monsters! It's time for your move..
Ghost Kaiba: Hmhmhmhmhm, and it's gonna blow your mind! This next card's a blast from the past, Yugi; with the emphasis on *blast!* .
(The ghost turns the card around and shows it-- it's a Blue-Eyes White Dragon! Yugi gasps, shocked and horrified; it can't be!) .
Ghost Kaiba: I attack with the Blue-Eyes White Dragon!.
Blue-Eyes White Dragon 3000/2500/L8/light.
Joey: Only *one* deck has got *that* card!.
Mokuba: That means... what they say, could it be true?.
Ghost Kaiba: Hahahahahaha, looks like the advantage is mine..
Yugi (think): So this really *is* Kaiba's deck. There's no other explanation. But does that mean that Kaiba, Kaiba is *really*--.
Ghost Kaiba: Don't worry, Yugi; my feelings weren't hurt when you called me a liar-- now admit that you were wrong!.
Yugi (Yami): Hmph..
Ghost Kaiba: Hmhm. Not having a real body *isn't* so bad; you would not believe what I save in food bills alone. But I still get to enjoy the finer things in life, like revenge! And I'm going to savor its sweet taste for a *very* long time!.
Mokuba: Shut up! Please, someone make 'im go away!! (starting to cry) Make 'im go away!.
Ghost Kaiba: Ha, almost breaks my heart-- if I had one..
Yugi (Yami): Huh....
Computer: We've easily broken through the Duelist Kingdom computer system..
Kaiba: Too easy. O-kay...  When it comes to computer duels, Pegasus has met his match. Now, it should be a piece of cake to find the field in which Yugi is dueling. .
Computer: I'm lookin', I'm lookin'... .
Computer: 'Access Denied'?!.
Kaiba: What did you do wrong?!.
Computer: Don't blame *me*; I finally found the security and it's all around Yugi's data!.
Kaiba: Ugh... I shoulda known. Fine by me, Pegasus. Go ahead and give it your best shot. There isn't a computer system anywhere on Earth that I can't break into. Here's the thing; every computer has a back door if you know where to look. And guess where we're gonna look?.
Computer: Beats me..
Kaiba: It'll be quicker if I take over on manual for a while. .
Kaiba: Data from all the duels is being beamed from the Island to an orbiting Industrial Illusions satellite, and back down to their mainframe. These transmissions are *obviously* highly encrypted. If we can somehow force the Industrial Illusions computer offline, I'm sure their backup systems won't have as much security. .
Computer: Are you sayin' we can make *their* computer crash? From *here*? But how?.
Kaiba: A computer *crash* is exactly what I had in mind; the biggest computer crash ever. And I'm going to use Pegasus' own satellite to do it!.
Computer: But I've already tried to hack into their systems..
Kaiba: My idea's different. Once the security is down we should be able to freely access the data. Be ready with a search for the Dark Magician..
Computer: Gotcha. Dark Magician inquiry, loaded and standing by..
Kaiba: Good. If Yugi's dueling, he's sure to use that card..
Computer: So spill it already. How the heck are we going to use Industrial Illusions' own satellite to bring down their computer?.
Kaiba: By bringing down the satellite itself-- down all the way!.
Computer: Loading satellite schematics..
Computer (VO): M-class Triton series. Booster rocket controls online.  Locating orbital coordinates..
Computer: Breaching onboard computer security. You are now the proud owner of an Industrial Illusions satellite..
Kaiba: Great! Now plot a crash course for the computer mainframe. .
Computer: Uploading new coordinates now..
Computer: We are locked on-target for the computer..
Kaiba: Hmph! Virus software won't stop *this*! Pegasus-- you're on notice that the Kaiba Corporation's still mine!.
Computer: Satellite impact in ten seconds....
Ghost Kaiba: Heheheheheheh.  I won't attack just yet. Why rush to victory when I can draw it out as long as possible instead?.
Yugi (Yami): Huh? (think) There's more to it than that. He's hiding some sort of magic card, I know it! (aloud) Dark Magician, go to defensive mode! And I summon Curse of Dragon, on the defense as well! .
Curse of Dragon 2000/1500/L5/dark.
Ghost Kaiba: Smart playing, Yugi. Unfortunately, it wasn't smart enough; you played right into my hand-- (he flips the facedown) Defense Paralysis (sic)!.
Yugi (Yami): A trap!.
Ghost Kaiba: Mmm. Now all your monster cards on the field have been switched into attack mode..
Téa: W-wha? .
Mokuba: Yugi!.
Yugi (think): While that Defense Paralysis card's on the field, my monsters can't defend themselves. I've got to think of a way out....
Ghost Kaiba: Ha! It's time! Blue-Eyes White Dragon, use your White Lightning! .
Ghost Kaiba: Well, so much for your Curse of Dragon..
Joey,Téa,Tristan,Mokuba: Yugi!.
Kaiba: No Dark Magician there. Next field..
Computer: We've exhausted almost every possibility of locating Yugi Muto. Field one-forty-six is the final active duel..
Kaiba: Then-- he's gotta be there! Search field one-forty-six!.
Computer: You got it--.
Kaiba: What's that?!.
Computer: Looks like I've crashed..
Kaiba: Reboot..
Computer: ...Back online..
Kaiba: *Enter field one-forty-six*!.
Computer: I'm frozen again!.
Kaiba: Hunh?.
Computer: It's worse this time..
Kaiba: Hang on. Watch this... .
(Kaiba types on the manual keyboard; a window comes up on his screen containing an image of the Dark Magician card, X'ed out, and an "ok" button.) .
Kaiba: Gotcha. Just as I thought. So. A virus. A *good* one. That means-- just one thing! Searching for Yugi's cards activates the virus! Yugi's inside-- get ready to go in!.
Computer: But, the security door--.
Kaiba: We've come this far already and I'm not gonna blow it! ... .
(A graphic of three sticks of TNT appears on the screen with a quick-filling loading bar.) .
Kaiba: Actually, *yes I am.* .
Kaiba: ... Huh? .
Kaiba: What's that?!.
Computer: It's a virtual fortress. Sensors indicate that all of the data from Yugi's duels is processed here. .
Computer: You won't blow your way through *this* thing; it's the ultimate defense! *And,* it's impossible to penetrate without the password!.
Kaiba: Hmmm... a password. If I know Pegasus, that egomaniac would never think that anyone would outsmart 'im and get even *this* far. We're goin' in..
Computer: The password?.
Kaiba: Heh-- 'Pegasus'! .
Ghost Kaiba: Hah....
Yugi (think): How can I defeat his Blue-Eyes White Dragon?.
Kemo: Heheh. Yugi, ya gotta admit, for a stiff, this Kaiba's sure got game!.
Mokuba: *That's not my brother*!! There's just *no way*! Yugi, you *know* that's not him-- everyone thinks he's a bad guy, but I know my brother, and he's not mean like this! He's my best friend in the whole world! That *thing's* not him!! Ugh, ya just *gotta* believe me!!.
Yugi (think): I wish I could be as sure as you, Mokuba. I don't know *what* to believe. But one thing I do know for sure-- this duel's not over yet. (aloud) "Magical Hats"-- conceal the Dark Magician! .
Ghost Kaiba: Huh?.
He's under there *somewhere*-- but which one!.
Ghost Kaiba: Hmph. Are you so desperate that you have your Dark Magician doing simple hat tricks?.
Yugi (Yami): It's not a trick-- and it's not *so simple*. Your move-- but you'd better think twice before you choose.  Just do the math-- four hats? Only twenty-five-percent chance you'll *find* the Dark Magician. The real question is, *what else* is hiding beneath those hats?.
Joey: Way to go, Yugi! Now that's what I like to call pullin' one outta your hat!.
Mokuba: Huh? All right...!!.
Computer: You were right about the password! The virtual fortress is unlocked. We now have access to Yugi's data, and it was just his turn..
Kaiba: Pegasus thinks he can make up all the rules in this game. But he could never have imagined *this* brand-new twist-- I'm back!.
Ghost Kaiba: Hmm, so predictable! *I* know where the Dark Magician hides..
Yugi (Yami): If you're so sure, then *move*..
Ghost Kaiba: It's a shame this duel's going to end so soon-- White Lightning! .
Yugi (think): If he attacks the right hat, I'll lose more than just this duel-- *much* more!!.
Yugi (Yami): Hm..
Ghost Kaiba: No! That hat was empty!.
Joey: Ha-right! This could work!.
Téa: It's *gotta* work..
Mokuba: Yugi'll beat that faker!.
Yugi (Yami): Your guess was wrong. Guess wrong again and it will cost you!.
Ghost Kaiba: Hunh? .
Yugi (Yami): There are still three "Magical Hats" left on the field, and *one of them* holds a special surprise *just for you*. If you destroy the hat that hides my Dark Magician, you'll win this duel. Choose the *empty* one, and it's my turn again. But I'm betting you'll pick the hat that conceals the trap card I just put into play!.
Ghost Kaiba: A trap card?!.
Yugi (Yami): Now-- which hat will it be?.
Joey: You're takin' a big gamble, Yugi!.
Tristan: If he guesses right, it's over!.
Ghost Kaiba: Blue-Eyes White Dragon, attack the middle hat!.
(The middle hat is obliterated in a stream of blinding white light. The air crackles where the hat once sat. The devious grin on Yugi's face clearly says that Ghost Kaiba made the wrong choice!) .
Yugi (Yami): Well, *now* you've done it-- activated my trap card, that is!.
Yugi (Yami): "Spellbinding Circle"!.
Yugi (Yami): A Blue-Eyes White Dragon is normally unstoppable; but once *drained* of its energy by the "Spellbinding Circle"....
Yugi (Yami): ...It's no match for the *full* power of my Dark Magician!.
Yugi (Yami): And that puts an end to your Blue-Eyes White Dragon..
Ghost Kaiba: Ugh....
Mokuba: Way to go, Yugi!!.
Blue-Eyes White Dragon 3000/2500//.
Tristan: Uh....
Joey: Whoa!.
Tristan: *Another* one?! .
Ghost Kaiba: Heheheheheheheh! And that puts an end to your Dark Magician. There are only three Blue-Eyes White Dragon cards in the world and they're all in my deck; your grandpa had the fourth but I ripped it up. But how could I possibly know that, if I'm not really Seto Kaiba? You know, I couldn't believe it when you beat all three of my Blue-Eyes White Dragons with Exodia, but now without that monster in your deck, there's absolutely no way you can win; your move..
Mokuba: Everybody heard about your duel with Seto; that's how *this* loser knows about it! *That's not my brother*, Yugi! I'm *sure*!.
Computer: I am now re-routing the data from Field One-Forty-Six at the Duelist Kingdom. After that, we'll be able to confirm if Yugi Muto is dueling there..
Kaiba: I'm sure he is. Now show me what you've got..
Computer: Here it comes-- we're in. Now downloading duel data.  (quick loading bar) You were right; Yugi Muto is in this duel..
Kaiba: Can you show it to me onscreen?.
Computer: My pleasure. I think the part you'll find *most* interesting is the name of Yugi's *opponent*..
Kaiba: What?! Is this your idea of a *joke*?.
Computer: I *never* joke. Sensors indicate that the opponent opposite Yugi is registered as Seto Kaiba-- and he's using your deck!.
Kaiba: Pegasus must've *taken* my deck....
Computer: The duelists are tied, and the impostor has his second Blue-Eyes White Dragon on the field; Yugi defeated the first one using a combination of the Dark Magician and Magical Hats. He currently has five hundred points left, and no cards in play; it's his move. .
Kaiba: But without... Exodia, Yugi can't win..
Kaiba (VO): He has no other cards left in his deck that can beat the Blue-Eyes White Dragon-- let alone *two* of them!.
Computer: Well, then, I hope you have a plan..
Kaiba: Yes, but we've got to work *fast*. Yugi'll lose on the next attack from the Blue-Eyes White Dragon....
(As they speak, again, we cut away to the duel, as Ghost Kaiba waits menacingly for Yugi to make his move.) .
Kaiba (VO): ...Unless we decrease its power from *here*..
Computer: Can we *do* that?.
Kaiba (VO): Oh, yeah. Upload a virus into that monster's holocomputer. That dragon is about to get sick-- *real* sick..
Computer: Standing by. But shouldn't we wait first to see Yugi's *next* move?.
Kaiba: We can't afford to risk Yugi losing the duel. Upload!.
Computer: Viral injection underway. .
Yugi (think): I don't have any monsters that can withstand his Blue-Eyes White Dragon. Ugh... this could be it...!.
Ghost Kaiba: This duel is over, Yugi; I'm *sure* we'll be hearing the fat lady sing right after your turn. I still have Defense Paralysis active, so whatever monster you pick won't be able to defend itself. .
Yugi (Yami): I choose the Feral Imp, in attack mode!.
Feral Imp 1300/1400//.
Kaiba: I wish Yugi waited a few more seconds before moving! Isn't there anything you can do to get that computer virus uploaded faster?.
Computer: We're *already* halfway there.  This is as fast as it goes. Viral implant now at sixty percent; but it doesn't seem to be working. .
Computer: The Blue-Eyes White Dragon is still showing no signs of weakness..
Kaiba (beginning to panic): Something is wrong!.
Ghost Kaiba: Hahahaha, this is almost too *easy*..
Téa: Yugi!.
Tristan: Hang on! Yugi can still win this!.
Joey: Huh! Don't forget, he *beat* Kaiba last time!.
Mokuba: Yugi...!.
Ghost Kaiba: It's time, Blue-Eyes White Dragon-- attack!!.
Yugi (Yami): Ugh! ...Huh?.
Ghost Kaiba: What're you waiting for?! Attack!.
Computer: The virus is taking effect! Blue-Eyes White Dragon's attack power is beginning to drop..
Kaiba: But it's still too strong! It *has to get weaker*-- or it'll still beat Yugi!.
Yugi (Yami): Wha--? I don't believe it! .
Ghost Kaiba: What's going on?! My Blue-Eyes White Dragon!.
(The pixels phase again, and Blue-Eyes' wings begin to melt, as though made of plastic and placed in an oven. It's streaming light from every direction.) .
Kemo: This is Kemo to Pegasus..
Kemo (via radio): I hope you're watching, sir, 'cause we got a real problem out here!.
Croquet: How did Yugi *do* that?.
Pegasus: It wasn't *Yugi*, it was *Seto Kaiba*..
Croquet: How?!.
Pegasus: It seems that the *real* Kaiba, is still very much alive..
Computer: The Blue-Eyes White Dragon's attack power is dropping rapidly. The virus implant is successfully disabling the monster completely. .
Kaiba: Alright, now let's get to work on dragon number *three*. .
Computer: Standing by--.
Kaiba: What's the matter?!.
Computer: We've been locked out by a remote terminal; looks like *we've* been hacked!.
Kaiba: Ugh!!.
Funny Bunny: Hey, Kaiba! Hey, Kaiba! Hey, Kaiba! Hey, Kaiba!.
Funny Bunnies: He-e-e-ey, Kaiba! Hey-y-y-y-y-y, Kaiba! He-y-y-y-y-y! Kaiba, Kaiba!.
Kaiba: Ugh! It's Pegasus! .
Funny Bunnies: Hey, Kaiba--.
Pegasus: Hahmhmhmhmhmhmhm....
Pegasus: Hmm....
- Move in! .
- On my mark... .
- Go!.
- Cover me!.
- Go, go, go, go!.
Computer: Attack power is holding now at two thousand. .
Kaiba: But this should've worked...!.
Computer: The Blue-Eyes White Dragon is launching its attack..
Kaiba: No!!.
Ghost Kaiba: Now, Blue-Eyes White Dragon, time to obliterate them!!.
Kaiba: Ugh...! *YUGI!!*.
Yugi (Yami): *Kaiba*...?!.
Kaiba: Ugh...!.
Kaiba: YUGI...!!.
Yugi (Yami): Kaiba!.
Yugi: It stopped...! Ah...! The dragon....
Ghost Kaiba: This can't be...! .
Joey: Wha... it's *gone*...!.
Kemo: It's a *trick*!.
Mokuba: Huh...?.
Computer: The Blue-Eyes White Dragon is destroyed; but the virus was not responsible!.
Kaiba: Then how? Did Yugi Muto somehow do this?.
Computer: How *could* he? It *is* *your deck*..
Kaiba: It's the Heart of the Cards...! Yugi was right...! Huh?.
Ghost Kaiba: Why...?! Why me-e-e?!.
Yugi (Yami): Why, because! Kaiba's still alive! *He* stopped you!.
Ghost Kaiba: Silence! *I* *am* *Kaiba*!.
Yugi (Yami, sharply): Enough! Your *charade* is over!.
Mokuba: My brother is alive!.
Téa: What's going on?.
Mokuba: It's like Yugi said. Last time Yugi dueled my brother, he showed Seto the Heart of the Cards! This *faker* may have taken his deck, but the real Seto Kaiba's alive and well!.
Joey,Téa,and Tristan: Oh....
Yugi (Yami): Impostor! The *real* Seto Kaiba destroyed that monster;  I know because I sensed him calling out to me when it happened. Now-- enough of your lies! We know you're not Kaiba! It's time for you to show us who you *really* are!.
Ghost Kaiba: I told you-- I *am* Kaiba!! Hahahahahahahaha! Or at least I'm part of him-- the darkest part!.
Yugi (Yami): Ugh!.
Ghost Kaiba: Eheheheheheh-heh. I can see you don't recognize me, Yugi..
Ghost Kaiba (VO): I wasn't *lying* when I told you I was Seto Kaiba-- the *evil* part of him that you sent to the Shadow Realm after our last duel! .
Ghost Kaiba: Now I'm back, thanks to Pegasus! Nyahahahahahaha!.
Mokuba: You're not a part of my brother anymore!.
Téa: Eeeww, it's hideous!.
Joey: I always thought that this duel just might turn ugly-- but I never thought *that* ugly!! .
- Sir, he got away. .
Croquet: Search the grounds. Everywhere..
Pegasus: Hmm. It appears that young Yugi's nemesis, the *real* Seto Kaiba, has come to his rescue. I must admit that this little development is one twist that even *I* did not foresee! .
Croquet: I have some bad news, sir. The real Kaiba has eluded us once again..
Croquet (VO): You were right; he was using a terminal in the Kaiba Mansion to access the Industrial Illusions mainframe. If I thought he was alive, I would've beefed up security..
Pegasus: That's two escapes, Croquet, must I lock *you* away? *Again*? .
Pegasus: Get me Kemo on the radio..
Mokuba: Hey ugly! If I were you, I'd start worrying about what my big brother's gonna do to you when he finally catches up to you!.
Pegasus (via radio): Pegasus to Kemo. Seto Kaiba has gotten away. Don't lose the little one, no matter what!.
Kemo: Understood..
Yugi (Yami): I guess I just don't know what to call you. I was thinking about 'monster'-- but I didn't want to insult the *cards!*.
Ghost Kaiba: Hm..
Yugi (Yami): It's your move; you've got a whole deck to go through and only one Blue-Eyes White Dragon left. .
Ghost Kaiba: Grappler in defense mode, ahahaha..
Grappler 1300/1200//.
Yugi (think): He's just biding his time until he draws his last Blue-Eyes. (aloud, Yami) It's my turn. .
Yugi (think): I'd play this card in defense mode, but he's still got his Defense Paralysis card in play. So I can only attack. And with no defense, if he draws the Blue-Eyes White Dragon I'm *finished*! (aloud, Yami) I'll set one card on the field and draw the Celtic Guardian as well, in attack mode!.
Celtic Guardian 1400/1300//.
Yugi (Yami): Your Grappler's *split*! .
Ghost Kaiba: Nyeh, parting is such sweet sorrow. Next up is Mystic Horseman in defense mode, and I'll lay one of my cards facedown *just like you*! .
Yugi (think): Facedown? Is it a magic card, or is he setting a trap? (aloud, Yami) Again I'll play a card facedown, and I'll use the Mystical Elf, in attack mode. Plus, this "Book of Secret Arts" (magic card) will raise its attack *and* defense power by three hundred points!.
Mystical Elf 800/2000/L4/light.
Yugi (Yami): My turn is over. .
Ghost Kaiba: Patience, Yugi, for it will soon be *all* over! (think) Yugi has two cards facedown and three monsters. He must be trying to strengthen the Mystical Elf somehow to withstand my Mystic Horseman's attack. But if I draw the final Blue-Eyes and destroy *any one* of his monsters, that will take his lifepoints down to zero anyway. Eheheheheheheh!.
Joey: I find it hard to *believe*, but I'm likin' the look on that guy's face even less than I did *before*!.
Téa: Wipe that smile off his face, Yugi!.
Mokuba: Loser! *Make your move*!! .
Ghost Kaiba: Hm hm hm hm, as you wish. (draws, gleeful) Ohh, prepare-- .
Yugi (Yami): Huh!.
Ghost Kaiba: For the Blue-Eyes White Dragon! .
Joey: Yugi!.
Mokuba: Don't worry, Yugi! My brother will help out just like last time!.
Kemo: Dream on!.
Mokuba: Huh?.
Kemo: Your luck's about to run out. Just see for yourself. .
Joey, Tristan, Téa, Mokuba: Huh?.
Kemo: *Unlike* the last Blue-Eyes, this one is at full power and your brother's in no position to do a thing *about* it! 'Cause we found where his hiding place is, and now he's on the run. .
Tristan: So that means, Kaiba *is* alive?.
Kemo: Dimwit. It means don't expect another miracle-- 'cause this duel's about to end!.
Mokuba: Ugh... Oh no!!.
Ghost Kaiba: Nyah-hah, such a good dragon-- wouldn't you say, Yugi? This duel's about to end now-- go-o, White Lightning attack! .
Yugi (Yami): This duel's not over yet! Activate "Mirror Force", now!.
Ghost Kaiba: Whough! He's turned over a trap card!.
Yugi (Yami): The Mirror Force reflects your attack right back at you!.
Ghost Kaiba: Pretty good trick; but I'm ready with one of my own. I'll use "Negate Attack"!.
Yugi (Yami): Huh! (think) He had a magic card waiting, just in case!.
Ghost Kaiba: "Negate Attack" neutralizes any attack thrown at me-- *even if it's one of my own*..
Téa: Yugi!!.
Mokuba (think): It's all over....
Yugi (Yami): Hmhmhmhm! It's time to finish this duel-- with Reborn the Monster (sic)..
Ghost Kaiba: Oh no! That allows you to revive any monster lost in this duel from *either deck*!.
Yugi (Yami): I'm glad you know the rules, now guess which card I want. Be reborn-- Blue-Eyes White Dragon! .
Ghost Kaiba (think): Aaaggh-haaahh... (aloud) Ouh, fat lot of good that move's gonna do you, Yugi; both of these monsters are evenly matched! .
Yugi (Yami): Their powers are not the same..
Ghost Kaiba: Houugh!.
Yugi (Yami): You forgot about my Mystical Elf. She's been chanting a spell since I put her on the field. It allows the Mystical Elf to transfer her own attack power, to any other monster I choose!.
Ghost Kaiba: Whaaat, this can't be!.
Yugi (Yami): This move was inspired by Seto Kaiba himself. He showed me that you can *alter* the attack power of a Blue-Eyes White Dragon. But I'm *raising* the power of mine, instead of *lowering* it like Kaiba did to *yours*. .
Ghost Kaiba: This can't be happening! Oh no- no!.
Yugi (Yami): Consider this a message from the *real* Seto Kaiba-- *YOU LOSE*!!!.
Ghost Kaiba: Grrbl...! .
Yugi (Yami): Now, Blue-Eyes-- Obliterate!!!! .
Ghost Kaiba: Whoa-a-a-a-a-a!.
Yugi (Yami): Pegasus may've helped you escape the Shadow Realm once before, but it *won't* happen again-- *NEVER* again!!!.
Yugi (Yami): Pegasus-- I sense that you're watching. Consider this a warning..
Yugi (Yami): Nothing you send against me will stop me; and when we finally duel, *believe* me, victory will be mine! I'll win back my grandfather's soul, and you will *pay* for all the people you've hurt in the name of your sick little game!.
Yugi (Yami): I'm coming for you, Pegasus!!.
Pegasus: Yugi, you've developed your shadow-powers quite a *bit*, in such a short time. But when we finally duel, believe *me*--  your Millennium Puzzle will be *mine*! Mmhmhmhmhm!.
Yugi (Yami): Kaiba....
Joey: That ghost is *toast*, huh, Yugi?.
Tristan: I knew that the *real* Kaiba was alive the *whole time*! .
Téa: Huh?.
Joey and Tristan: Hm?.
Joey: What is it?.
Téa: That creep took Mokuba!.
Joey and Tristan: Whoa!/Huh?.
Yugi (Yami): Huh...! Mokuba!.
Téa: I can't believe it!.
Yugi (Yami): Mokuba?! He's gone. Taken again..
Tristan: Oh, no...!.
Joey: Hey, Mokuba!.
Téa: Mokuba! .
Yugi: Mokuba? Mokuba?!.
Joey: This is no time to be playin' hide-'n'-seek, kid!.
Tristan: Those thugs must've snatched 'im back to Pegasus' castle..
Téa: So now they've got your grandpa *and* Kaiba's little brother, too?.
Joey: Looks that way....
Yugi: It's just another reason for us to win those ten star chips and get in there..
Joey: No doubt!.
Joey: Whoa. Huh. It's my lucky day!.
Tristan: Hands off, those're *mine*..
Yugi: Cool Tristan! I didn't know *you* were training to become a duelist!.
Tristan: Yeah, well, I figure if a doofus like *Joey* can hold his own in this game, then hey-- I'll probably be an expert at it!.
Joey: Oh... I recognize *that* monster! .
Yugi: Haven't I seen that card in *your* deck, Joey?.
Joey: Not *this* one. But I think I got somethin' just like it. Hmm....
Joey: Bingo! Swamp Battleguard! Well, wouldya take a look at this! These two look like they're long-lost brothers! A' course, that doesn't mean *your* boy packs the same kinda wallop *mine* does! .
Tristan: His 'wallop' is just fine! My Lava Battleguard has never let me down. Try 'im out-- you'll see!.
Joey: Thanks. It *does* say they work best *together*....
Téa: Ya know what, I think I kinda see a resemblance between you two and those *muscleheads*....
Joey: Laugh it up! I take that as a complement!.
- I-it's your move, Mai..
Mai: Oh, Harpies, give that monster our kind of *makeover*-- attack! .
Mai: *Wow*, that was a real challenge, it ranks right up there with doing my *nails.*.
- But I was ranked fourth in my district finals!.
Mai (yawn): Yeah, yeah, that's great, hon..
Mai (think): I don't get it, trashing hotshot duelists is usually as fun as a fall clearance sale. Why can't I *enjoy* it anymore? .
Mai: Rrrrggh! It's all because of that obnoxious punk Joey! I can't *believe* such an amateur beat me!! .
Mai: I've got to get even with that grinning gutter punk! Huh?.
Rex: It's me, Rex Raptor the dino duelist! And I'm itchin' to finish that match we started on the boat!.
FlashBack Mai: Bon voyage, *loser*!.
Mai: *Funny*... I thought I already *knocked* you on your Jurassic butt..
Rex: Think whatever you want; you're about to get *stomped*!.
Mai: You think I'm gonna waste another minute with a peabrain like *you*? Beat it, dino-breath! (Adding to the insult, she makes little shooing motions with her hand) Shoo, shoo!.
Rex: Unnngh, *peabrain*?! I happen to have been a finalist in this year's regional championship! And I'll have you know that I've already won *five* star chips!.
Rex: *Whoa*!! How'd you get eight chips *already*?! .
Mai: From wannabes like *you* who think that by dueling a *chick* they'll score some easy stars! I've only lost once, but once I find that punk kid Joey, it's payback!.
Rex: Joey *Wheeler*? How couldja lose to *him*?.
Mai: I'd love to see *you* try and-- (think) *Wait*... (aloud) Okay, Rex, I'll duel you-- if you do something for *me*, first!.
Téa: Wow. After all the crazy duelists we've been running into, it's nice to see some *normal* kids for a change. .
Tristan (to Joey): Yeah, how 'bout it, tough-guy? (Joey jumps a little) Any of these tykes *puny* enough for you to take on, or d'ya wanna go looking for some *three-year-olds*?.
Téa: Come on, be nice. You know Joey's just biding his time until he finds a dueling *monkey* to challenge!.
Tristan: Hahaha! Dueling monkey, *nice* one!.
Joey: Who wants some?! Just *one more word* about *duelin' monkeys*, and I'm gonna--.
Mai: Ahahaha!.
Joey: Ugh, *tell* me that's not who I *think* it is....
Mai: How are you, Joseph, glad to see me?.
Joey (unenthusiastically): Ecstatic..
Mai: So Joey, is *Yugi* still fighting all your battles for you? Everyone *knows* if Yugi wasn't there to hold your hand, you wouldn't have beat me. Isn't that *right*, Yugi?.
Yugi: That's not true..
Mai: Oh, *really*! Then I propose he steps out of your shadow *here and now*! (she points an accusing finger at Joey) If Joey thinks he's so tough, let's see him play for *himself*!.
Mai: I'm *waiting* for your answer, Joey! Think you have the guts to step up and face the duelist I've arranged for you? .
Joey: ... It's not *you*?.
Mai: Mmmhmhmhmhm..
Rex: I'm dueling on Mai's behalf. Recognize me?.
Yugi: That's Rex Raptor!.
Joey: This twerp supposed to scare me or somethin'? I betcha he ain't so tough!.
Téa: Don't you *remember*, Joey?! *Rex placed second in the Regionals*! .
Mai: *Well*, Joey? Ya gotta ask mommy's permission or what?.
Joey: No way! This is *my* fight!.
Téa and Tristan: *Joey*! .
Téa: What are you trying to prove?.
Tristan: *Really*, bro, pick your battles!.
Rex (think): I can't *believe* Mai agreed to duel me just for stomping this *amateur-us* rex! Heheh!.
Mai (think): Joey had *Yugi's* help when he beat *me*, so having Rex do all my dirty work is the perfect revenge! (aloud) Oh, and by the way....
Téa: Hmm?.
Mai: If little Yugi does any of his backseat dueling, then Joey is disqualified and the match automatically goes to Rex. .
Yugi, Téa, Tristan, Joey: Huh?!.
Mai: Whaddaya say, Joey? This is your big chance to prove yourself-- or are you gonna back out?.
Téa: Of *course* he is, we--.
Joey (cuts her off): No!  That's the way I want it, just me an' him..
Joey: It may cost me all my star chips, but I don't deserve to keep 'em if the only reason I'm winnin' is 'cause a' Yugi's smarts. All my life, people're tryin' to help me 'cause they think I can't help *myself*. Well, I don't need to be babied *this* time!.
Tristan: You've *lost* it, Joey! You can believe whatever you want, but I won't just *stand* here and watch you throw your chips away! I hope you guys don't mind, but *little Joey* won't be comin' out to duel today. Maybe once he grows up we can arrange a playdate--.
Joey: That's it!! Ugh!.
Tristan: Hey, wha'd ya shove me for?!.
Joey: Didn't ya hear what I just said, wise-guy?! I'm tired of everyone thinkin' they gotta come to my rescue!.
Yugi: But that's not how it is; friends look out for each other--.
Joey: Keep outta this, Yuge. Just lemme do what I gotta do..
Tristan: Great idea; do *what* you gotta do-- even if it means losin' the chance to help your sister!.
Joey (think): Serenity....
Joey (VO): Don' worry, sis; I'll make ya proud. .
Téa: L-listen, let's just *cool off* a sec. .
Tristan: Forget it! If mister macho *wants* to lose he can do it by himself!.
Yugi: But Tristan--.
Joey: Let 'im *go*..
Rex: Ahh, some trouble in paradise?.
Téa (angrily): Stay outta this!.
Téa: Huh?.
Mai: *So*, what's it gonna be? You gonna run off with your *friend* or start acting like a *real* duelist?.
Joey (reckless smile): I'm still here, ain't I? Yugi-- no offense, but I want ya to keep outta this one..
Yugi: Uh... (nods) Hmm..
Rex: All right-- then it's dino feeding time!.
Téa: We believe in you, Joey!.
Téa: Just don't forget what you're fighting for!.
Joey (think): What I'm fightin' for? I got *that* part down-- it's *who* I'm fightin' that's makin' me sweat!.
Rex: Eheheh....
Mai: Rex! Don't forget our deal-- beat him and y'get to duel with me!.
Joey (to Rex): I can't believe ya reduced yourself to bein' Mai's attack dog! .
Rex: 'Least I'm no *dueling monkey*!.
Joey: Rrrgggh!!!.
Rex: Whoa!! So how many chips d'you wanna lose to my dinos?.
Joey: I got two-- but I plan on doublin' them right here!.
Rex: You wish! I bet your deck isn't even prepared for the fields we're playing on!.
Joey (think): *Man*, if he only knew! I still have a hard time tellin' one field from another, let *alone* usin' 'em in any kinda strategic way. My best bet's gonna be hittin' 'im hard and fast, an' I think I know just the cards to do the job-- Baby Dragon and Time Wizard!.
Joey (VO): If I use 'em together, I can speed up time an' make my Dragon super-powerful. Hey-- it worked once before when I dueled Mai, so here's hopin' it'll do the job again!.
Rex: Quit stallin'! Let's duel!.
Joey: Bring it!!.
Yugi: Hmm... Hey, Téa, keep rooting Joey on for us-- I gotta go see about something! .
Téa: Wha? Yugi!.
Joey (think): Pay dirt! I couldn'a *asked* for a better hand!  (aloud) Heehee hee hee... .
Joey (think): Huh? Where'd Yugi go? Oh well. Wait'll he sees what I did all by myself!!.
Baby Dragon 1200/700/L3/wind.
Joey: Baby Dragon, defense mode! .
Rex: Ah?.
Joey (think): *That's* right, it's a *Baby Dragon*-- Rex knows he's *toast*!.
Rex: Ya never leave a baby unattended, and you're about to find out why! Two-Headed King Rex! Attack!!.
Two-Headed King Rex 1600///.
Rex: *Poor baby*. Looks like we found out what he was made of!.
Joey: But... I didn't get to play my combo...!.
Rex: And d'ya know why? Because even *three-year-olds* know better than to defend on their first move!.
Joey: Rrghh...
Rex: Ha! I can't believe you actually did that! You rookie!.
Téa: Everyone makes mistakes, Joey! Just try not to make another one! .
Mai: Ahahahaha! You don't get it, do you, little Joey's already *made* the one fatal mistake that's gonna cost him this entire duel--  and *that* was ever agreeing to this match in the *first* place!.
Joey: Ugh....
Joey: Unggh....
Rex: Ha! With your Baby Dragon crushed, my Two-Headed King Rex can terrorize the field for the rest of the match!.
Joey (mutters): All right, maybe I *did* screw up. But I think I still have one monster in my hand that can beat that thing..
Leogun 1750/1550/L5/earth.
Joey: Leogun! Show that overgrown iguana who the real king a' beasts is!.
Rex: Ha ha ha, you amateur! Since we're on a wilderness field, my King Rex gets a nice, fat power bonus! Tough luck for your pussycat!.
Joey: Field bonus?! *Now* he tells me!.
Rex: King Rex, footstomp!.
Joey: Ouch!.
Rex (think): The quicker I bash this tenderfoot, the sooner I'll get to have my chance at beating Mai! (aloud) Let's go! You're the appetizer; I wanna get on to the *main course*! .
Joey: I still got plenty to serve up! That is, if I finally figured out how to use this 'field power bonus' thing right. (he pulls a card from his hand; Axe Raider.) Here goes nothin'..
Axe Raider 1700/1150/L4/earth.
Joey: Axe Raider!.
Joey: He-hey! He got the power bonus!.
Joey: I did it!.
Rex: Don't let it go to your head! Sword Arm of Dragon! Cut that Axe Raider down to size!.
Sword Arm of Dragon 1750/2030//earth.
Rex: Sword Tail Slash!.
Joey (think): That's my third monster he's trashed. Even *with* the field power bonus I can't beat 'im..
Téa: Joey!.
Téa: Don't let that dino-dork intimidate you! Remember, we're all right behind you!.
Joey (think): Yeah, right-- that's why Yugi an' Tristan ditched me....
Tristan: What a nimrod. Hm! (splash) Big dumb-- hm! (splash) -- jerk!.
Yugi: You okay, Tristan?.
Tristan: *Yuge*?! > Whaddaya doin' here, you should be helpin' Joey!.
Yugi: Joey made it pretty clear he didn't want my help on this one. And since you left, I figured maybe I should, too..
Tristan: Me being there and you being there are two totally different things! .
Tristan: Without your coaching, Joey won't last *two minutes* against that conniving little freakasaurus! I don't care *what* he says, ya gotta go back there and help 'im out pronto!.
Yugi: I can't do that. Joey needs to fight this duel on his own and I gotta *let* 'im..
Tristan: *Yugi*!.
Yugi: If I go back on my promise and help Joey, he'll be disqualified! Besides, we've gotta believe in him so he believes in himself!.
Tristan: Rrrrgh... (Tristan lets Yugi go and turns away) Yeah, well... maybe I don't think he can win!.
Yugi: But, Tristan, this is about something more important than winning or losing. This is about Joey learning to be a strong big brother for his little sister. And even though he doesn't need our help, he needs to know he has our support..
Tristan: Ah, I don't know....
Joey (think): Maybe this was a mistake. Maybe the only way to help my sister *was* by relyin' on my friends. No, that's not true!  I can't start thinkin' that way! If I can't rely on myself, how can I expect my little sister to? Now *think*. There's gotta be *something in this hand* that I can play. Hmmmph... Huh! Wait! I still have this Time Wizard! Too bad I don't have my Baby Dragon to play it with anymore. Oh well. I guess it couldn't hurt to put it out on the field anyway. Here goes nothin'..
Joey: Time Wizard!.
Mai (think): Hmm. That's the card Joey beat *me* with. I should warn Rex! (aloud) Raptor! Watch that Time Wizard!.
Rex: Ah, without Yugi's help this chump doesn't even know how to use it! (think) *I* know Joey's type; he'll try an' play a monster next and then he'll be in for the prehistoric pounding of his life!.
Mai (think): Maybe Rex is *right*..
Mai (VO): Joey *was* able to defeat my Harpie Ladies, but *only* because *Yugi* coached him through it! This time Joey's all *alone*..
Joey: I'm playin' Rock Ogre in defense!.
Rex: Ahaha, ya see?  I knew the rookie didn't know what he was doing! Megazowler!!.
Megazowler 1800/2000//.
Rex: Wreck that rock old-school style! Horn Ramming Charge Attack!.
Rex: Reduced to rubble! I sure sent *him* back to the stone ages; nah-heh-heh!.
Joey: Fine! Go, Flame Swordsman!.
Flame Swordsman 1800/1600/L5/fire.
Joey: Turn up the heat an' carve that dino like it was a big turkey!.
Rex: Didn't you see what I did to your Rock Ogre? D'ya really think that your puny little Flame Swordsman will last any longer? Looks like I 'm gonna hafta teach you respect for my dinos *the hard way*! Ata-a-ack!!.
Mai: Rex, you big dino-dummy!.
Joey: Flaming Sword of Battle!.
Rex: Rrgh....
Joey: Urrgh....
Rex: Tell me how a swordsman could beat a dinosaur...!!.
Joey: ...I actually *won* that?.
Mai: There is *no way* Joey could've known  that dinosaur cards are *especially* vulnerable to *fire*. That *jerk*, he totally lucked out on that one!.
Joey: Heheh, looks like I found the secret to beatin' your dinos; hope you're not too *sore* about it. Get it? Sore? Dino? Dino-sore?.
Rex: Sword Arm of Dragon!.
Sword Arm of Dragon 1750/2030//earth.
Joey: Want some?! Come an' get it, buddy!.
Téa: Yeah!! I knew you were gonna make a comeback, Joey!.
Rex: This is *far* from over, ya know! *One card* won't win this for you..
Joey: All righty then, I'll just bring out another forya! Swamp Battleguard!.
Swamp Battleguard 1800/1500//.
Rex: Big *deal*. I have a beast that'll wipe that smirk off your face *permanently*!.
Rex: All right!!! Meet the top link a' the food chain! Serpent Night Dragon! .
Serpent Night Dragon 2350/2400//.
Joey: Uh...?!.
Rex: *This* rare card's awarded to the elite few who've made it to the final round of the regional championships--  but for a loser like *you*, it should be an honor just to get *thrashed* by it! Nightmare Sonic Blast!.
Joey: Ugh, ugh... he was my best card....
Téa: Oh, poor Joey....
Joey: Man; there's not a monster in my *deck* that could save me now....
Joey (think): Tristan's card....
Joey (VO): Man, he always shows up somehow. .
- Hey, this don't *concern* you, *hair-job*. .
- Yeah, didn't no-one ever teach you not to mess wit' other people's business?.
FlashBack Joey: Didn't anyone teach *you* that you shouldn't be pickin' on defenseless little kids half ya size?.
- Then howabouts we pick on *you* instead?.
FlashBack Tristan: Hey-- everything all right, Joey?.
FlashBack Joey: Huh?.
- Mess 'em *both* up!!.
FlashBack Tristan: Yo! Watch that guy!.
- Let's go!.
FlashBack Tristan: You okay, Joey? You shoulda called me; I'd've been here earlier, man..
FlashBack Joey: Whaddaya doin' here, Tristan?.
FlashBack Tristan: Whaddaya talkin' about?.
FlashBack Joey: I coulda taken those guys. I 'preciate ya tryin' to help me out, but I don't need to be babied..
Joey (VO): *Man*....
Joey (think): ...All this time, and it finally hits me. Tristan's always been lookin' out for me. (aloud) Not because he thinks I always need his help, but because he's a true friend! .
Tristan: Yo! Joey!.
Joey: Huh? Wha?.
Tristan: We're here for ya, buddy! So how 'bout it? You gonna take that card a' mine for a test-drive or what?.
Yugi: He-hey...!.
Joey: You got it, pal! Go-o-o-o-o, Lava Battleguard!.
Lava Battleguard 1550/1800/L5/earth.
Tristan: Cool! My card's on the field!.
Rex: What a *touching reunion*. Too bad my Serpent Night Dragon is gonna blast it to shreds! Now! Attack the green one! .
Rex: What?! My sonic blasts are being deflected!.
Rex/Joey: Huunnggh!.
Rex: How was my Dragon's attack repelled?! There aren't any trap cards out!.
Tristan: Huh? Oh, I get it, the red one blocked for the green one! .
Joey: Tristan's card was there right when I needed it most....
Yugi: Of course! Those two monsters are like best friends, so when they're together on the field they help power each other up! Just like how you and Joey help each other out in real life, huh, Tristan?.
Tristan: That's what bein' a buddy is all about....
Joey (to Tristan): Thanks for everything, man! I owe ya!.
Yugi: What a team! Not only did you take out Rex's monster, you made a nice dent in his lifepoints, too! .
Rex: Nnnyrrrgh!.
Joey: Right! An' now that we're together again....
Tristan: ...There's not a monster Rex has that can stop us!.
Rex (think): Eheheh... celebrate while you can; because your party's about to be crashed!!  Nah-hah-hah-hah!!.
Rex: Your horned freaks may've won control of the field....
Rex: But now it's time to see if you can *hold* it. Trakodon!.
Trakodon ///.
Joey: Battleguard! Give that card a bashin'!.
Tristan: Whoa, look at 'em glow! Those guys're *some* kinda tag-team!.
Yugi: Wow, you're right about that! The power bonus they gain from both being on the field at the same time makes them a tough two to beat! .
Tristan: No joke! And since Joey's already taken out Rex's best monster card, the rest'll be *cake*! Finish 'im, bro!.
Rex: Ha!.
Joey: Huh?.
Rex: Who *said* that Serpent Night Dragon Joey destroyed two turns ago was my *best card*? .
Rex: Hmm! My supreme monster *is* a dragon, *but of a different sort*!! The Red-Eyes Black Dragon!.
Red-Eyes B. Dragon 2400/2000//dark.
Joey: Ahh!.
Mai: A *what* dragon?!.
Rex: Your pair of primates can power up 'til they're green in the face, they're *still* no match for the thrashing power of this beast! .
Joey: Ugh....
Yugi: So it *does* exist. My grandpa told me about this card.  Its powers are said to rival those of the legendary Blue-Eyes White Dragon..
Mai: It's about *time* Rex played a card that'll put Joey in his place....
Rex: And if you think those brain-dead brutes of yours will rescue each other from *this* dragon's rampage, think again! With "Dragon Nails", my Red-Eyes gets a power boost strong enough to clobber an *army* of your Battleguards!.
Rex: Red-Eyes Black Dragon! Inferno Fire Blast!.
Joey: How could 'e torch 'em *both* with just one shot?!.
Rex: Those who defend together, are *destroyed* together! Don't *tell* me ya thought their little clubs would be enough to save them from my dragon's wrath..
Tristan: That creep!.
Rex: Neh-heh-heh-heh-heh!.
Joey: Rrgh....
Mai: Mmhmhmhm, that's a good boy, Rex, nice work..
Rex: D'you smell that *odor* in the air, Joey? It's the stench of your defeated Battleguards; who's up next for the roast? Nah-hah-heh! .
Joey (mutters): Gotta stay calm....
Tristan: Hang in there! .
Téa: Yugi, tell me that dragon *isn't* as tough as it looks. I mean, there must be *something* Joey can do to stop it...?.
Yugi: Hmmm... (think) I wish I could *answer* her! 'Cause there *is* one last move that could save Joey from that Red-Eyes. But I'm barred from giving advice in this duel. Joey's gonna have to figure out this one all by himself..
Rex: Play every monster ya got; my dragon has enough firepower to turn your whole deck into a smoldering pile of ash! .
Joey (think): Rex is right; no creature *I* have can out-muscle *that* thing! Man... I guess this is where I get my *butt* handed to me....
Tristan: Yo, Joey! .
Joey: Wha?.
Tristan: You may not have the monster to beat that thing, but you got the smarts!.
Yugi: We're not giving up on you, Joey!.
Téa: Don't forget-- dueling's more about heart than strength!.
Tristan: Now show this lizard what you're made of!.
Rex: Yeeah... that's it, Joey. Slap down another card for my Red-Eyes to fry up-- huh? (think) I almost forgot. Joey still has his Time Wizard out from a few turns ago. That's the card he played to clobber Mai and her Harpies--  *with* Yugi's help, that is! Shame Joey's too much of an amateur to know how to use it himself! Nah-hah-hah-hah!.
Mai: Hey, are you gonna nab me the victory you promised, or are you gonna sit there with that dumb look on your face?!.
Rex (think): *Again* with the insults? I can't *wait* to wreck that arrogant attitude of hers in our duel! Wait a minute. If I can snag Joey's Time Wizard, it would be the perfect way to shut her up; she can't win against that card! (aloud) Oh, Joey!.
Joey: Huh?.
Rex: I have an idea. Let's make this duel more exciting and each put one card up for grabs with our star chips. And just so it's fair, we'll both put up whatever card we have on the field, sound good?.
Joey: Wha? I don't *have* any cards on the-- huh? Oh yeah, my Time Wizard, I forgot about that!.
Rex: And for him, I'll give you my *rarest* card; the supreme Red-Eyes Black Dragon! .
Joey: Huh...?.
Mai: Just what do you think you're doing, you disobedient dolt! You're here to take Joey *out* of this tournament, not to improve your deck! .
Rex: Eh? Stay outta this!.
Mai: Rex, you double-crossing *snake*! I know what you're scheming! .
Rex (petulantly): I'm no lousy snake, I'm a *dinosaur*, you know that..
Mai: Ha! You're no din--.
Joey (think): That Red-Eyes Black Dragon could really help my chances at winnin' this tournament, and gettin' its prize money for my sister... but I hate to risk this Time Wizard Yugi gave me, like it was some *bargaining chip*. Wait a minute... what'm I talkin' about? Maybe I don't *have* to! (aloud, steely) You got a deal, Rex! Your Red-Eyes Dragon and my Time Wizard, winner takes all! .
Mai: *What*?!.
Rex: Yeah!!.
Téa: Uh....
Yugi: It's a gutsy move..
Rex (think): Sucker! Heh....
Joey: Huh! But while I'm at it, Rex-- I'm makin' him my weapon a' choice, too! Go, Time Wizard!.
Time Wizard 500/400/L2/light.
Rex: What're you doing?!.
Yugi: Joey just figured out the best possible move for this situation..
Mai: This wouldn't be happening if you'd just obeyed my commands, Rex!.
Joey: Now, I hope ya packed your bags, Rex, 'cause if my Time Wizard's spin arrow lands on a time warp, you'll be on the next boat *off* this island!.
Rex: D'ya really wanna leave this entire duel up to a single spin? Ya *do* know what'll happen if that arrow lands on a *skull*, don'tcha? .
Joey: It's a risk I gotta take; Time Roulette, go!.
Téa: What happens if the arrow lands on a skull?.
Yugi: It'll self-destruct and take a chunk out of Joey's lifepoints..
Tristan: Aw, man-- all he's *got* is a chunk!.
Téa: I can't believe this entire duel has come down to one spin! It's almost too nerve-wracking to even *watch*!.
Yugi: All we can do now is hope that arrow doesn't land on a skull..
Tristan: Okay-- then let's start hopin'..
Joey (think): C'mon, time machine....
Rex (think): Come on, skull....
Téa: It's stopping...!.
Mai: Slowly....
Tristan and Téa: Yeah!!.
Yugi: Way to go, Joe!.
Rex: No! .
Joey: A'right-- time warp, go!.
Time Wizard: Time magic!.
Rex: You jerk! Look what you've done! The entire space-time continuum is speeding out of control! Eons are passing like seconds! .
Rex: Aaaagh... Huh?!.
Téa: He's been... fossilized. .
Mai: No...! He hasn't. He's still standing. Sure he's beginning to gray a little, but that's natural. Go on and have him attack, Rex..
Mai: Go *on*, Rex!.
Rex: Right. Uh, Red-Eyes? Go on and attack....
Rex: Ouagh! No, no, no-o-o-o-o! .
Yugi: The millions of years that Joey's Time Wizard made pass has turned Rex's dragon into a brittle shell of dust!.
Rex: Mmgh... So I guess you won my star chips, huh? .
Joey: *Wait* a second. Not only did I win your *star chips*, but I won your Red-Eyes, too-- fair and square!.
Rex (wails): Aauaauaugggh!.
Téa: All right!.
Yugi: And he did it all by himself, too..
Joey: I did it, guys! I did it!!.
Tristan: Hey, you're the man, Joey!.
Joey: Yeah, you know it!.
Tristan: Comin' right atcha, man!.
Joey: Gimme some skin, bro!.
Tristan: Up high, or down low!.
Tristan: I guess you're down low, bud..
Joey (red-faced with surprise): You- you shoved me! After everything I just went through, you go an' *shove* me?!.
Tristan: Yeah? Well, tough tamale! Now we're even for when *you* pushed *me*!.
Joey: Eh! Don't you know two wrongs don't make a right, ya jerk?!.
Tristan: Should I make it *three*, then?!.
Joey: Bring it on!.
Yugi: Come on, guys, there's no need to *fight* over this!.
Téa: Maybe we oughta stay outta this one. I think this is their bizarre way of showing each other they care. .
Yugi: Oh... Okay....
Yugi: I just hope they don't care about *me* that much....
Yugi: Boy, it sure got *dark* in a hurry..
Téa: Yeah, maybe we oughta set up camp somewhere..
Tristan: Don't tell me you're *afraid*, Téa?  You got *us* protecting you!.
Téa: Yeah-- but who's protecting *you* guys?.
Tristan: Uhh, good point. Let's set up camp..
Joey (laugh): Relax, guys! There's nothin' in these woods but crickets and squirrels!.
Tristan: ...And when they finally pulled over to look and see what was in the back seat of the car....
Tristan: ...It was over twenty pepperoni pizzas with double cheese and meatballs!.
Téa: Oh please, what kind of ghost story is that supposed to be!.
Joey: Arrgh, if I don't get some food in me *I'm* gonna be turnin' into a ghost!!.
Téa: Those two and their stomachs, huh, Yugi?.
Joey: Huh? Hey-y-y, my meal ticket!.
Tristan: Wha?! No!!.
Yugi: Wild mushrooms are poisonous, Joey!.
Mai: So do us all a favor-- .
Mai: ...*And let him eat it*! Mhaha!.
Joey: *Now* whaddaya want, Mai?.
Joey: That's it! You can duel me, you can insult me, but you're not *eatin'* in front a' me!!  .
Mai: You're that *hungry*, are you? Okay, then, give me your star chips and I'll give you some food..
Joey: Guh! (shakes it off) Forget it! Potato chips-- I mean, star chips are priceless!.
Mai: I was just kidding, Joseph. I'll more than happy to share if *you* can manage to ask politely like a gentleman..
Joey: Right, so then you can go an' make fun a' me for that, too?.
Mai: Look, by tomorrow I'll have won entrance to the castle so there's no point in me keeping an *entire* knapsack full of food. .
Joey: Mmmmgh....
Yugi (wistful): Sure would be nice not to have to duel tomorrow on an empty stomach..
Joey: How do we know this isn't another trick! Gimme just *one good reason* to trust you!.
Mai: 'Cause it's either me or that poisonous mushroom..
Yugi: Look at all this stuff! Candy bars--.
Joey: Dibs on the candy bars..
Yugi: --Potato chips--.
Tristan: Dibs on the chips!.
Yugi: --Canned fruit-- (total silence) --Soda--.
Joey: Dibs on the soda..
Mai: Sorry, boys, no dibs on *anything* yet. At least not until you complete your chores. I want *Yugi* to go look for some firewood..
Yugi: Sure..
Mai: And *you* two boys can go and fetch us some water..
Tristan: You bet. .
Joey: If she's not slingin' insults then she's barkin' orders....
Tristan: I'm willin' to swallow my pride if it means swallowin' some food!.
Yugi: I'll go and gather us up that firewood..
Téa: Okay..
Mai: What's *your* name? Téa, is it?.
Téa: Mmhmm..
Mai: Well, Téa, if you wanna freshen up a bit there's a makeshift shower just over there..
Téa: Uh, thanks, Mai!.
Mai: Hanging out with those boys is no reason to have to *smell* like them!.
Yugi: Joey, I don't think we should cook the *candy bars*....
Joey: Back off, I know what I'm doin'....
Téa (think): Mai sure is a hard gal to read. One minute she's starting trouble with us and the next we're sharing a campfire..
Mai (teasing): Look at you go, Joey, only thing missing is a chef's hat! .
Mai: And a *cute apron*..
Joey: Geez! Alright, already!.
Mai: Now *keep cooking*!.
Téa: You're *tough*, Mai!.
Mai: Us gals've got to look out for each other, especially with a buncha bozos like *them* around. .
Mai: I don't know why you even bother hanging out with them!.
Téa: That's easy, Mai; they're my best friends..
Mai: *Those* gooFlashBackalls? In my experience, their type is only good for moving furniture or fixing cars. .
Téa: Hey, Mai?.
Téa: Aaah!.
Mai: What's wrong?.
Téa: I heard something moving around right outside!!.
Mai: Huh... Well it's gone now..
Tristan: Wow! It sure smells good!.
All: Time to dig in!.
Tristan: Mmm-- tasty!.
Joey: Ah, thankya very much! .
Yugi: Not bad. How's yours, Téa?.
Téa: Mmm, four stars!.
Yugi (innocently): Speaking of *stars*, I hear you've won a few, Mai. How many do you have? Eight? Or is it nine? However many, it sure sounds like you're in the zone!.
Mai: Huh! Don't think you're gonna fool me with your 'nice guy' routine, *Yugi*. It's only a matter of time before you--.
Téa: Can't we just forget about the tournament for *one night*?.
Tristan: Let's make fun a' Joey instead. That's always fun..
Mai (sweetly): Okay, just as long as everyone is crystal-clear about *one little thing*-- (flatly) any duelist in my way is going down! .
Mai (primly): Now, if you'll excuse me, I'm going to go for a walk..
(Mai stands up and walks away from the campfire, down the path toward the sea. They watch her go.) .
Joey: Ugh, man, she can really ruin a meal!.
Mai (think): I should never have sat down with those losers! Even if they *do* seem like kinda *nice*... losers... And *friendly*... And-- no! I can't afford to go *soft* now. I'm a *duelist* first, and that means *everyone* is an enemy. (aloud) So no friends for me. I want to win. And I'll do it all alone..
Joey: Man, oh, man! (yawn) I'm fadin' fast here. .
Téa: Don't you think we should check on Mai?.
Yugi: Good idea. .
Tristan: She *has* been gone for a while..
Joey: It's probably some *trap*..
Téa: Hmm....
Yugi: What was that?!.
Joey: Yep. Betcha she's been waitin' there the *whole time*. Come on out, Mai!.
Yugi: It's Bakura!.
Téa: See?! I *told* you!.
(Flashback. On the boat to Duelist Kingdom, Téa peers out from behind a corner as Bakura walks to the railing of the ship and looks out at the water.) .
Téa (VO): I *haven't* just been seeing things!.
Joey: Whaddaya doin' way out *here*, Bakura? .
Bakura: Same as you guys, I guess. .
Tristan: You gave us a scare sneakin' around in those bushes. .
Joey: Yeah, for a minute there we actually thought we had somethin' to worry about! Heheh, pretty silly, hah?.
Tristan: Joey, you've been starin' at that card for like an hour, what's up?.
Joey: I'll tell ya, just don't laugh..
Joey: Sometimes, when I'm in a duel, I pretend that it's *me* out there on the field swappin' blows with whatever card my opponent has out. Heheheh, isn't that dumb?!.
Bakura: Well if you *were*, which card would you want to be, Joey?.
Joey: Uhh... *this* one! .
Joey: The Flame Swordsman kicks *everybody's* butt! Hahhh!.
Tristan: Not *my* guy's-- the Cyber Commander! .
Téa: You boys and your cards are hilarious!.
Yugi: I think *everyone* has a card they can identify with. You should see if you can pick one for yourself, Téa..
Téa: Okay. I pick *this* one-- Magician of Faith..
Tristan: What? Ya gotta be kiddin' me. .
Joey: More like the magician a' *freaks* if ya ask me! .
Téa: Shut up!.
Bakura: Tell me which one *you* identify with, Yugi..
Yugi: Oh, that's easy-- Dark Magician, hands down!.
Téa: Maybe I'm just out of the loop, but don't you guys think it's a *little* silly to be comparing ourselves to *playing cards*? .
Yugi: Maybe a *little*, but it's like grandpa says; it's not about the playing cards, it's about putting a little bit of your *heart* into anything that you care about, you know? .
Yugi: So which card do *you* care about most, Bakura? .
Bakura: This one is *my* favorite..
Téa: Huh?.
Yugi: Isn't that the "Change of Heart" card?.
Joey: Kind of a weird-lookin' picture, don'tcha think?.
Bakura: Hmm. If you wanna see how it works, we could have a duel right *now*. Not for star chips, just for a little fun. .
Joey: Sure. I'm down with that. After all this 'star chip' stuff, it'll be nice to have a duel with no strings attached..
Yugi: I agree! I think just a regular ol' duel sounds like a *great* idea..
Bakura: Why don't you guys each put *your* favorite card into Yugi's deck, so it'll be like we're *all* playing? .
Joey: That's a good idea. .
Tristan: Yeah!.
Yugi: Great! But I should warn you that with this all-star team of cards, we'll be tough to beat! .
Bakura: True-- but maybe I'll surprise you..
Téa: This'll be fun. .
Yugi: All right, I'm all shuffled..
Téa: Now, you're sure you don't mind playing alone?.
Joey (thumbs-up): Don't you worry about a thing, Bakura; we'll go easy on ya..
Bakura: Thanks..
Joey: Right. Now let's get this duel on the road!.
Bakura: Before we get started, there's a little something I'd like to *share* with you all..
Tristan: Huh?.
Bakura: And especially with *you*, Yugi. .
Joey: What's that?.
Bakura (slight laugh): You'll see..
Téa: What's he doing?.
Joey: This is gettin' freaky...!.
Yugi: No-- it *can't* be! (think) *A Millennium Item!*.
Yami Bakura (think): Yes-- and the magic of my Millennium Ring will take us to the Shadow Realm!.
Joey (looking around nervously): Man, I hate magic....
Yugi: Why are you doing this, Bakura?!.
Yami Bakura (think): You've something I want, Yugi-- and I aim to *take* it!.
Yugi: Huh-AHH!.
Joey: Huh-UGHH!.
Tristan: Huh-AGHH!.
Téa: Huh-ohh... .
Yugi, Joey, Tristan, Téa: Who-o-o-o-o-a-a-a-a!.
Yami Bakura: Hmhmhmhmhmhmhm. That wasn't *too* difficult. Their souls have been locked away. And now, after waiting for countless centuries, the legendary Millennium Puzzle is mine!.
Yami Bakura: Uggggghh....
Yami Bakura: No! It- can't be!.
Yami: You want my Millennium Puzzle? Then you're going to have to *duel* me for it. But if I win, you'll *release* my friends and send us all *back*!.
Yami Bakura: Haha, I agree to your ridiculous terms, Yugi! But I promise you-- there is more at stake *here* than you comprehend, and this is one shadow game that *you cannot win*!.
Yugi (Yami): Bakura, what have you done?  Why have you taken us to the Shadow Realm?.
Yami Bakura: Hmhmhmhm. Bakura! Bakura's no longer *here*. .
Yugi (Yami): If you're not Bakura then who are you!.
Yami Bakura: I am a thief and a stealer of souls... .
Yami Bakura: ...And I have done terrible things in my quest to possess the Millennium Items! You *do* remember the legends, don't you? .
Yami Bakura: 'Whosoever wields all seven Millennium Items will possess power unimaginable!' And before I'm done with you, your Millennium Puzzle will be mine!.
Yugi (Yami): That's not going to happen, *whoever* you are..
Yami Bakura: Then let the shadow game begin!.
Yami Bakura: The first move is yours..
Yugi (Yami): And my first card, the Cyber Commander, Tristan's favorite. .
Cyber Commander 750/750/L2/dark.
Yugi (Yami): *Tristan?!*.
Tristan/Cyber Commander: Huh? What a weird dream! .
Tristan/Cyber Commander: Huh? Where am I? What's goin' on here? Waaugh!.
Yugi (Yami): Bakura must've used his Millennium Ring to capture Tristan's soul within his favorite card!.
Yami Bakura: Heheheh. Who's your little friend, Yugi?  He *looks* pretty tough, but can he deal with *this*! The White Magical Hat!.
White Magical Hat 1000/700/L3/light.
Yami Bakura: Attack!.
Tristan/Cyber Commander: Oh, man..! I must still be dreaming! .
Tristan/Cyber Commander: Yeah, that's it. This is all just a really bad-- haaa-aaghh!.
Yugi (Yami): No, Tristan!!.
Yami Bakura: Hmhmhmhm. Ah, looks like that card's been *defeated*, and your poor friend's soul was trapped within it..
Yugi (Yami): *Where is he*?! What've you done with Tristan?!.
Yami Bakura: Your friend is gone, on his way to the discard pile-- or the *graveyard* as we call it in Duel Monsters. .
Yugi (Yami): It can't be...! Tristan can't be... *gone*....
Tristan/Cyber Commander: *Man*, this place is creeping me out big-time. But how'd I *get* here? I remember being attacked, and then, next thing I know I'm wandering around this graveyard. Huh? What's this...?.
Tristan/Cyber Commander: No...! According to this tombstone, I'm *dead*!! But this can't be...!!!.
Yugi (Yami): Rrrrgh...!.
Yami Bakura: Hmhmhmhm. When you duel in the Shadow Realm, the stakes are always higher, Yugi! You made a sloppy move, and now your friend-- he paid for it with his very soul! *Now*, which of your friends will you sacrifice next?.
Yugi (think): I'd *avoid* using the cards that have my friends' souls trapped in them if I could, but to *save* my friends, I have to win. And I only have one card that can beat his White Magical Hat! (aloud) Joey's favorite card-- the Flame Swordsman!.
Flame Swordsman 1800/1600/L5/fire.
Joey/Flame Swordsman: Hey... what gives? Hey Yugi, y- GAAAAAAHHH!! What the?! You're a giant! Oh man, I've finally cracked....
Yugi (Yami): Joey, *listen* to me. Your soul has been sealed inside your favorite card;  you've *become* the Flame Swordsman! .
Joey/Flame Swordsman: I'm the *WHO*?! .
Yugi (Yami): If I don't win this duel, we can't restore you to normal, but if you're defeated in this battle, you'll be carried off to the Card Graveyard just like Tristan was! .
Joey/Flame Swordsman (whimpers): *Graveyard*?!.
Yugi (Yami): In order for me to win this duel, restore you all back to your bodies, *and* get us out of the Shadow Realm, I'm going to need your help..
Joey/Flame Swordsman: You want my help, you got my help!.
Yugi (Yami): Are you sure you're okay?.
Joey/Flame Swordsman: *Okay*? I figure I lost my mind, but I'm gonna go with it. *Now*, who wants a beatin', huh? (turns around) Aaagh! Giant Bakura? Now I *know* I'm nuts; I'm like six inches tall, wearin' a dress, about to fight my giant friend? .
Yugi (Yami): That's not really Bakura. An evil spirit from his Millennium Ring has taken him over..
Joey/Flame Swordsman: We-e-ell! I have no idea what you're talkin' about, so here goes nothin'. (charges) Haaaaaaaaahhhhh!! Say goodbye to the cat in the hat! .
Joey/Flame Swordsman: *Whoa*, man! I did it, Yugi! Now what?.
Yugi (Yami): Now it's *his* turn. .
(Bakura's lifepoints now stand at 1200, Yugi's at 2000.) .
Yami Bakura: Rrrgh, your little Swordsman got lucky last time, Yugi; but not *this* time! .
Yugi (Yami): Uh? Why'd he play that *facedown*?.
Joey/Flame Swordsman: 'Cause he's afraid a' what Joey the Swordsman'll do to it!.
Yugi (Yami): Hang on, Joey, it could be a trap..
Joey/Flame Swordsman: I'm goin' in..
Yugi (Yami): Wa-a-a-i-it!!.
Joey/Flame Swordsman: Haaaaahhh!.
Morphing Jar 700/600/L2/earth.
Joey/Flame Swordsman: Huhsaaaaahh-chak! .
Joey/Flame Swordsman: Ta-da!.
Yami Bakura: What a dolt..
Yugi (Yami): It was a *Morphing Jar*!.
Joey/Flame Swordsman: Huh? A Morphin' Jar? Did I screw up?.
Yugi (Yami): When a Morphing Jar is attacked, all cards in *both* players' hands go to the graveyard. We're just really lucky I didn't have *Téa's* soul card in my hand right now. .
Joey/Flame Swordsman: Whoa. *Sorry*, Yuge!.
Yugi (think): Ah! The Dark Magician! He's *my* favorite card! But is it also my *soul card*? What happens when I play it?.
Yami Bakura: Hmhmhmhm.  With a new hand... (facedown monster) comes a whole new perspective. The game... (facedown card) ever-shifting. New dangers surround every turn. .
Yugi (think): He's trying to freak me out. But I can't figure out what he's *up* to. I'm just going to have to risk playing....
Dark Magician 2500/2100/L7/dark.
Yugi (Yami): The Dark Magician!.
Yugi/Dark Magician: Ah...! Huh?.
Yami: And I'll play a card that lets me *revive* monsters from the graveyard-- Reborn the Monster!.
Tristan/Cyber Commander: Huh? What the?! *Joey*? *Yugi*? You guys dreamin' this too?.
Joey/Flame Swordsman: Nah, this ain't no dream, Tristan; this is just me goin' insane. 'S all one big delusion..
Tristan/Cyber Commander: Huh?.
Yugi/Dark Magician: ...But just one second ago I was up *there*..
Tristan/Cyber Commander: Yeah... if you're down *here*-- who's that up there?.
Yugi/Dark Magician: I don't know..
Yami: *Don't* you?.
Yugi/Dark Magician: Ah... well I *have* noticed that sometimes, when I duel, it feels as if someone is *guiding me*..
Yami: Hmm..
Yugi/Dark Magician: A-and sometimes it's like I can hear a strong voice calling out to me from my Millennium Puzzle. An ancient, powerful voice..
Joey/Flame Swordsman: Huh...?.
Tristan/Cyber Commander: Really?.
Yugi/Dark Magician: I'm not sure what it's all about, guys, but I'm pretty sure we can trust him-- *whoever* he is. .
Joey/Flame Swordsman: Hey; if the big guy is okay in *your* book, then he's okay by *me*. .
Tristan/Cyber Commander: Yeah..
Yugi/Dark Magician: So *now* what? .
Tristan/Cyber Commander: Maybe we should try and find Téa..
Yugi/Dark Magician: She must still be in the deck. .
Joey/Flame Swordsman: Then we should try an' win this thing before her card gets played. .
Yugi/Dark Magician: Good idea..
Joey/Flame Swordsman: I'm gonna bash me some Bakura...!.
Yugi/Dark Magician: Hang on, Joey, *I* was just played, so *I* have to move. Dark Magic Attack!.
Yugi/Dark Magician: No! Another Morphing Jar!.
Yami Bakura: Hmhmhmhm. We'll have to send all the cards in our hands to the graveyard again..
Yugi/Dark Magician (to Yami): I'm sorry..
Joey/Flame Swordsman: 'S okay, man, I did the same thing..
Yami: Ugh! No! The Magician of Faith!.
Yami Bakura: Hmm; isn't that *Téa's* favorite card? Do you suppose that her mortal soul is trapped within it?  Hmmm, I wonder? Maybe you should *play* it and *find out*! But then again... (places a facedown monster) You don't know what I'm laying here, so you might be putting her in danger! A dilemma. And while you decide, I'll just activate this trap card-- .
Yami: No!.
Yami Bakura: "Just Desserts"! .
Yami Bakura: I think you'll find it will help you come to *grips* with your present situation. .
Yami Bakura: Hmhm. "Just Desserts" takes five hundred points from each of your monsters on the field. And you'll feel like each and every point has been ripped from your beating heart! .
Tristan/Cyber Commander: Big Yugi! Are you okay?.
Yami: Yes-- but one more attack like that-- and it's over!.
Tristan/Cyber Commander: Whoa, that trap card just *nailed* Yugi's lifepoints-- or maybe I should say, *our* lifepoints..
Yami: Another hit like that, and it could be over for *all* of us. (think) Téa's soul card is not safe in my hand; I'll have to play it. (aloud, as he places a facedown monster) Rrgh! .
Téa/Magician of Faith: Uh... heh....
Téa/Magician of Faith: Hey! What's up! .
Joey/Flame Swordsman: Huh, boy....
Téa/Magician of Faith: Uh, guys...?.
Joey/Flame Swordsman (quickly, under his breath): Stay quiet!.
Téa/Magician of Faith: It's a little *early* for *Halloween*, don't ya think?.
Téa/Magician of Faith: Huh?! What the?! What's this?! .
Joey/Flame Swordsman: Shush! Bakura an' Yugi are big duelin' giants an' are fightin' for our souls!.
Téa/Magician of Faith: But Yugi's right *here*!.
Yugi/Dark Magician (nervously): Yeah, well, the big guy's not really *me*, but he's not really *not* me....
Téa/Magician of Faith: Huh?!.
Yugi/Dark Magician: I know it's complicated, but it has something to do with the Millennium Items Bakura and I have; it's some kind of *magic*..
Téa/Magician of Faith: Magic? So I'm *not* crazy!.
Yugi/Dark Magician: Not unless we're *all* going crazy!.
Joey/Flame Swordsman: Just think of it *this* way, Téa. There's *two* Yugi's-- the cool one up there, an' the puny one down here. .
Yugi/Dark Magician: Ugh- daah! .
Téa/Magician of Faith: Huh?.
Yugi/Dark Magician: ...Ogh, that's not how it works at all!!.
Joey/Flame Swordsman: Just a joke, relax...!.
Yugi/Dark Magician: You forget that *here*, I have the powers of the Dark Magician. .
Tristan/Cyber Commander: Uhh, Yugi, I wouldn't do that if I were....
Yugi/Dark Magician: I'll show *you* who's *puny* around here!.
Electric Lizard ///.
Joey/Flame Swordsman: Uh, boy....
Yami: Yugi! Wait!!.
Yugi/Dark Magician: Dark Magic Attack!.
Joey/Flame Swordsman: All right!.
Téa/Magician of Faith: Great job, Yugi!.
Téa/Magician of Faith: Wha? No!.
Tristan/Cyber Commander: What was *that*?.
Yugi/Dark Magician: W-whatever it was it's making me go numb!.
Joey/Flame Swordsman: Hang in there, pal!.
Yami: Yugi!.
Yami Bakura: Hahahahah! You can't attack the Electric Lizard without some rather *shocking feedback*; a lesson your little Yugi won't soon forget! .
Yami (think): A trap card. (aloud, as he places it) All right, soul-stealer! I'll play my next card facedown-- and it's your move..
Yami Bakura: Don't bother, you fools, I can see her perfectly well!.
Yami: Huh?.
Yami Bakura: Now I have all four of you right where I want you... helpless on the field, easy prey for my Man-Eater Bug! .
Man-Eater Bug 450/600/L2/earth.
(Bakura places a monster facedown in defense mode. Téa nervously stands as all of them eye the card.) .
Téa/Magician of Faith: *Man*-Eater Bug? Glad I'm a girl..
Joey/Flame Swordsman: Yugi, what's *that* card do?.
Yugi/Dark Magician: Uhh, t-the Man-Eater Bug can automatically- destroy one creature on the field as soon as it's flipped up!.
Téa/Magician of Faith: (gasp!) Well, that's certainly *not good*....
Tristan/Cyber Commander: Guys, I *really* don't wanna go back to that graveyard....
Joey/Flame Swordsman: Don't you worry, Tristan; none of us're goin' back! We'll destroy that bug before he plays it! .
Yugi/Dark Magician: That won't work. .
Joey/Flame Swordsman: Huh?.
Yugi/Dark Magician: The moment we make an attack, that card will activate..
Tristan/Cyber Commander: Graveyard, here I come....
Joey/Flame Swordsman: Whaddaya sayin', Yuge? That one of us is gonna end up worm-food?.
Yugi/Dark Magician: I-I'm saying that there's only one way out of this-- and we're standing on it!.
Tristan/Cyber Commander: Ri-i-ight! The trap card Big Yugi laid down!.
Yugi/Dark Magician: Yeah, but I'm afraid to use it. The card requires that we sacrifice a creature. .
Téa/Magician of Faith: You mean, one of us?!.
Tristan/Cyber Commander (bravely): Don't worry, Téa, *I'll* go..
Téa/Magician of Faith: No way, Tristan!.
Tristan/Cyber Commander: Think about it; that Man-Eater Bug's gonna take *one* of us out no matter *what* we do! At least this way I'm takin' it out too-- whoa!!.
Tristan/Cyber Commander: Ough... I guess you disagree....
Joey/Flame Swordsman: You just got back from the graveyard. If *anyone's* goin', it's *me*! .
Yugi/Dark Magician: Joey, wait!.
Téa/Magician of Faith: It's too late!.
Joey/Flame Swordsman: Haaaaaaaaaaaaahhhhh!!.
Joey/Flame Swordsman: How tough could this bug be?!.
Joey/Flame Swordsman: Aaaa-aaaghh! Big Yugi! Use the trap! Do it! Do it now! Please!! I- I don't want my friends to get hurt! Aaaagh!.
Joey/Flame Swordsman: Sacrifice me-e-e-e!!.
Yami: I'm activating a trap, sacrificing my Flame Swordsman to do so. The "Horn of Heaven"! Blasting its celestial tune directly at your Man-Eater Bug, obliterating him from the field once and for all! .
Yugi/Dark Magician: B-but, Joey...!!.
Téa/Magician of Faith: What's happening to him?.
Tristan/Cyber Commander: He's disappearing...!.
Joey/Flame Swordsman: Don' worry about me-e-e...!.
(Both Joey and the Man-Eater Bug vanish. Yugi, Téa, and Tristan are devastated; Téa sobs.) .
Tristan/Cyber Commander: He's gone...! Just like that, my best buddy's gone! .
Yami Bakura: Hmhmhm. Don't worry, you'll soon be joining him in the graveyard. You can spend an eternity together!.
Yami: Rrrghh....
Joey/Flame Swordsman: The graveyard. Pretty creepy... but they got *Tristan* back, so *maybe*... huh?.
Joey/Flame Swordsman: Gaaah!!.
Joey/Flame Swordsman: The Reaper of Cards! And he's come for me!! Hohh, no..!!.
Yami Bakura: I hope you don't harbor any illusions about rescuing your friend Joey from the graveyard. You've already played Reborn the Monster, the only way to get him back! And soon the Reaper of Cards will claim his soul, forever! .
Téa/Magician of Faith: Poor Joey... he sacrificed himself....
Joey/Flame Swordsman: Ahh-haaaaahhh....! Aaahhh...! St-stay away from me!.
Joey/Flame Swordsman: Aaaaaaahhhh!.
Téa/Magician of Faith: He *can't* be gone....
Yugi/Dark Magician: Hm? *Téa*...? .
Yugi/Dark Magician: Wait, she's the Magician of Faith! Téa's tear activated the magic effect of her favorite card! .
Yami: That's right. And the effect of the Magician of Faith allows me to bring back one magic card from the discard pile and add it to my hand. .
Yami: And the card I choose? (slaps it down) Reborn the Monster, which I play *now*!.
Joey/Flame Swordsman: Nnngh...!.
Joey/Flame Swordsman: No, I don' wanna...! Wha? .
Téa/Magician of Faith: Joey!.
Yugi/Dark Magician: Joey! You're back!.
Joey/Flame Swordsman: All right!.
Yami Bakura (to Yami): You waste your time and your turns rescuing these foolish mortals..
Yami: *My friends* are never a waste of time! Make your move..
Yami Bakura: Hmhm. Oh, I'll move. And you will lose.  *This* is the play that will end the match and win me your Millennium Puzzle. First, I will play the Lady of Faith in attack mode..
Lady of Faith 1100/800/L3/light.
Yami Bakura: And then the card that will turn your friends against one another-- the "Change of Heart"!.
Yugi/Dark Magician: "Change of Heart"..! Isn't that *Bakura's* favorite card?.
Yami Bakura: And a very magical card it is. With this card I can turn you against your comrades; the very friends you sought to protect, you will now destroy!.
Yugi/Dark Magician: No, I refuse!.
Yami Bakura: You won't have a choice in the matter! .
Yami Bakura: The "Change of Heart" card allows me to control *any* opposing monster-- and I choose you, little Yugi! Hehehahah!.
Yami: Leave the young one out of this!.
Yami Bakura: Why should I? By simply destroying him I defeat *you* as well. You're here to guide and protect *hi-i-i-im*?!?! Then protect him against *this*!.
Tristan/Cyber Commander: Yugi!.
Joey/Flame Swordsman: Yugi!.
Téa/Magician of Faith: Yugi!.
Yugi/Dark Magician: Uggghhhh....
Joey/Flame Swordsman: It's *Bakura*!.
Téa/Magician of Faith: The *real* Bakura!.
Yugi/Dark Magician: Bakura! So your soul was sealed into *your* favorite card, too!.
Bakura/Change of Heart: I want to help, but we must act quickly, Yugi!.
Bakura/Lady of Faith: I've taken over one of *his* cards instead of yours!.
Yugi/Dark Magician: Huh?.
Yami Bakura: Aaugh!.
Bakura/Lady of Faith: I'll control her while you attack *me*! You *can win* against the *evil* Bakura!.
Yugi/Dark Magician: I can't! I'd be destroying you, sending you to the graveyard!.
Bakura/Lady of Faith: I don't care, it's better than being enslaved by an evil spirit! *Do* it!!.
Yami Bakura: Be quiet!!!.
Yami: I have a better idea! If the evil power of Bakura's Millennium Ring can pull souls *from* people, perhaps the power of my Millennium Puzzle can put them back!.
Joey/Flame Swordsman: All right! *Our* Bakura's back where he belongs!.
Tristan/Cyber Commander: But where's the *evil* dude?.
Yami Bakura/Lady of Faith: Ugh...! This can't be!! .
Yami: Listen closely, Yugi. Use the power of the Dark Magician; send him to the graveyard, *now*!.
Yugi/Dark Magician: You got it! Dark Magic Attack!.
Yami Bakura/Lady of Faith: Ugh...! Ouaaagh!!!.
Yami Bakura: The Millennium Puzzle was almost mine!!.
Yugi: Are you okay, Bakura?.
Bakura: I am now, thanks to you..
Yugi: Hmm. Where did you get your Millennium Ring?.
Bakura: My father picked it up on one of his trips..
Bakura (VO): He told me it's from ancient Egypt; I think that's where they're *all* from. .
Bakura (VO): He was shopping in a merchant bazaar when the Millennium Ring caught his eye..
Bakura (VO): The man who sold the Ring to my father said it had something to do with Duel Monsters; but that never made any sense to me, since the card game is new and the Ring is clearly ancient..
Bakura: When my father got back, he gave it to me. He said he felt I was destined to have it. .
Tristan: I just dreamt Bakura went totally mental!.
Joey: Same here! Last time *I* snooze with duelin' cards under my pillow....
Bakura: Sleep well, guys?.
Tristan and Joey: Bakura!!! ...Huh?.
Tristan: Hands off..
Joey: You grabbed *me*..
Tristan and Joey: Huh?.
Téa: Uh... I dreamt... we were dressed as duel monsters, and there were two Yugi's! .
Bakura: Ah....
Mai: Aaaaaaaahhhh!!!.
Joey: What was that?!.
Yugi: I don't know....
Yugi: ... But whatever it is, we'll face it together!.
Tristan: Whoa! What a nightmare. I just dreamt Bakura went totally mental..
Joey: Same here; last time *I* snooze with duelin' cards under my pillow!.
Bakura: Sleep well, guys?.
Tristan and Joey: Bakura!!.
Téa: I dreamt, we were dressed as duel monsters... and there were two Yugi's!.
Yugi: Huh?.
Joey: That voice...! Sounded like Mai. Come on!.
Panik: Hahahahahaha, bye bye, birdies!.
Mai: My Harpies! They're gone...!.
Panik: Eheheheheheh, I think you mean *eliminated*. Heheheheh, just like you! Now hand over all your star chips-- you loser! .
Mai: Ugh! Oh....
Panik: Heheheheheheheh....
Yugi: Mai! Are you okay?.
Mai: You're too late!.
Téa: Too late for what? .
Joey: This sideshow freak givin' you a hard time?!.
Panik: That's right, just like Pegasus pays me to do-- root out all the dueling *filth* on this island and dispose of it!.
Tristan: Doesn't that make you a *garbage man*?.
Mai: This is no joke! Panik's one of the island's *Eliminators,* and if you don't get outta here he's gonna do to you what he did to me!.
Yugi: Eliminator? What's that, Mai?.
Panik: Look! This is what she means right here! Check out her duelist's glove-- not a star chip left!.
Téa: ...But that would mean she's been disqualified..
Yugi: You're *out*, Mai?.
Mai (sadly): I am. It all happened so fast! The way Panik duels, I just... lost it..
Téa: This *isn't right*..
Panik: Hah! She was one of my easiest victims yet! Hahahahahahahahah!.
Joey: You creep!.
Joey: Move it! There's no excuse for pushin' a girl!!.
Bakura: Calm down, Joey, I know how you feel but that guy's more than twice your size!.
Joey: I can take 'im!.
Yugi: No, Joey, fists aren't the answer. .
Yugi: I've dealt with a lot of bullies in my life, and I'm afraid there's only one way to deal with them. .
Yugi: You have to stand up to them!.
Yugi: Yu-Gi-Oh...!!.
Mai: But *Yugi*--.
Yugi (Yami): Now-- let's see you try your intimidation tactics against *me*, Panik. I don't scare easy, especially when I'm standing up for my friends! It's time to duel!.
Joey: Alright, Yugi, no problem! Show Panik here how we *deal* with thugs like him!.
Panik: *Yugi*, huh? Must be my lucky day! Pegasus has promised a generous bounty to the Eliminator who defeats you! I wonder-- think he'd throw in some extra cash for inflicting bodily harm? .
Mai: Be careful, Yugi! Panik's *ruthless*, he had me *totally* *terrified*!.
Yugi (Yami): *I* see how you work, Panik;  sneaking up on unsuspecting duelists because you haven't the courage to challenge them face-to-face! .
Panik: Watch your mouth, you insolent cur!!.
Yugi (Yami): *True duelists* fight with honor and respect, not the underhanded tactics of a *poacher*! .
Panik: Rrrgh...!.
Yugi (Yami): And to prove it, I wager all the star chips I have to win back Mai's!.
Panik: It's a deal! If you win, I'll give you all eight of her star chips! The bet makes no difference to *me*! .
Yugi (Yami): What do you mean?.
Panik: What I *mean*, *little Yugi*, is that when you duel against Panik, you're putting much more than just your measly star chips on the line! Much more!.
Panik: Wahahahah, hahahahahah, mwahahaha, hohaha, hwahahahahah!.
Téa: Yugi!.
Yugi (Yami): Rrrgh!.
Téa: Yugi!.
Joey: We gotta get 'im outta there!.
Yugi (Yami): Rrrgh!.
Panik: Hahahahahahahaha! What's the matter, Yugi? Hmm? Can't take the heat? Well get used to it, because you're strapped in for the long haul!.
Joey: Turn it *off*, Panik!.
Panik: I can see the fear growing in your eyes, Yugi! I do believe, you're beginning to *panic*! Huhuhuhuhuhuh!.
Téa: Get a life, you psycho!.
Joey: Forget this guy, Yuge!.
Tristan: Yeah, no joke! Come on! Let's getcha down from there, Yugi, whaddaya say?.
Yugi (Yami): Are you finished blowing smoke, Panik?.
Téa: *Yugi*...!.
Joey: What's he think he's *doin'*?.
Yugi (Yami): It will take much more than cheap pyrotechnics to make me lose *my* cool..
Panik: Hahahahahaha! The last time someone had the nerve to talk to me like that, I broke them in half! Now let's duel!.
Mai (think): Yugi's good, but he's never faced an *Eliminator* before. Once Panik gets inside his head, it's all over!.
Panik: Seeing how the blaze of my fire didn't faze you, let's turn *down* the lights. My Castle of Dark Illusions will turn this duel into your darkest hour, Yugi! Its magic shrouds the field with a veil of shadows; and the Castle itself is extra-fortified, thanks to the field power bonus I get for playing it at night!.
Castle of Dark Illusions 920/1930/L4/dark.
(Castle's improved stats are 1196/2509//) .
Yugi (Yami): I'm not afraid of the *dark*, Panik!.
Panik: Heheheheh! You would be if you only knew, the fearsome nightmares within its shade! Hahaha!.
Mai: Don't listen, Yugi!! This is exactly how he threw me off *my* game!.
Yugi (think): Time to find out what I'm up against. (aloud, Yami) Celtic Guardian, defense mode!.
Celtic Guardian 1400/1200/L4/earth.
Panik: Not a very bright idea!.
Yugi (think): I *can't see what monster he played!*.
Panik: Huhuhuhuh, attack! Dark Grasp of Fury!.
Panik: Our first victim of the night!.
Yugi (Yami): Rgh... Tough talk, Panik, coming from someone who makes all their attacks while hiding in the safety of shadows!.
Panik: You uppity little cretin! You're *afraid*, Yugi; you're lost and alone in the dark, and I'm the *big bad bogeyman*!.
Yugi (Yami, smiles): Hmhmhm..
Panik: Huh?! If you could see what I have in store for you, you wouldn't be laughing! .
Yugi (Yami): But that's *why* I'm laughing. Because I *can* see. Right through you..
Panik: What?! What are you talking about, you little runt!.
Yugi (Yami): You *are* the bogeyman, Panik, scaring *children* into being afraid of the dark; until they realize the dark is nothing to be afraid of. Like you. .
Panik: Huh?.
Yugi (Yami): Once a person conjures up the confidence not to be fearful of the unknown, they've disarmed the only weapon the dark has!.
I'm not gonna panic! .
Here in the shadows, phantom of the night,.
Attack without warning, a single strong light,.
I'll brave the darkness, make my stand right here--.
No matter how you come at me I'll show no fear!.
(Then Yugi boldly presses on, and shows his next card: .
Winged Dragon, Guardian of the Fortress #1 1400/1200/L4/wind .
It takes the field as we go into the chorus of the song.).
I won't give up!.
I won't break down!.
I'm not gonna panic!.
Yugi (Yami): Fireball attack!.
I will not run!.
I'll stand and fight!.
What you done wrong I will set right, .
No matter what you try tonight!.
I'm not gonna panic!.
Panik: Hahahaha, attack!.
Fill my heart with terror, do the worst you can do, .
Shivers up my spine, I'm not afraid of you.
The dark can be scary, until you find.
Things you thought were fright'ning are only in your mind!.
(At the end of the verse, Panik summons his most fearsome creature:.
King of Yamimakai ////.
Yugi refuses to show fear, and plays a defense monster as we go into the chorus.).
I won't give up!.
Yugi (Yami): Curse of Dragon!.
Curse of Dragon 2000/1500//.
I won't break down!.
Panik: Reaper of the Cards!.
Reaper of the Cards 1380/1930/L5/dark.
I'm not gonna panic! .
I will not run!.
I'll make my play!.
Yugi (Yami): The "Spellbinding Circle", a trap card!.
I won't give up!.
I won't break down!.
Panik: No-o-o!.
I'm not gonna panic! .
Panik: My lifepoints! .
Yugi (Yami): What's the matter, Panik? Has bullying lost its thrill? Now let's bring all of your monsters into the light!.
Panik: Hunh...?.
Yugi (Yami): I dispel all your darkness, with the "Swords of Revealing Light"!!.
Panik: Stop! Stop it! I can't stand the light!!.
Yugi (Yami): Your monsters are revealed!!.
Tristan: Hah! No one keeps Yugi in the dark!.
Yugi (Yami): And my "Swords of Revealing Light" do more than simply *illuminate your monsters*, Panik! They also cause all your monsters on the field to be frozen for three turns, starting *right now*. That means, you can't make any attack while I implement my strategy..
Panik: Yugi-- Swords or no Swords, you can forget your foolish delusions of victory! I've just drawn the Chaos Shield card! .
Yugi (Yami): Oh, no; that effects all the monsters on the field. It puts them all in defense mode and raises their defense points! .
Panik: You're thinking too *small*, you fool! Or don't you realize that I can combine my Chaos Shield with my Castle of Dark Illusions!.
Mai: This is bad!.
Panik: With this combination, I can project a defensive shield over my entire area!.
(A shimmering barrier descends from the Castle of Dark Illusions like a translucent curtain.) .
Mai: Now Yugi can't get anywhere *near* his monsters!.
Joey: Whoa... .
Téa: What's that mean?.
Mai: Panik's untouchable while Yugi's a sitting duck!.
Panik: Huh! As long as the Chaos Shield is in place, your monsters can't touch me! Admit defeat now! You can see how the Shield raises the defense points of my monsters!.
Yugi (think): He's right. That shield protects against any possible attacks, even from my *strongest* monsters..
Mai: Mmm... I hate to say it... but Yugi really doesn't stand a chance. Breaking duelists is what Panik does for a living..
Panik: Give up! Admit defeat! I'm going to crack you like an egg! .
Yugi (Yami): You'd *like* me to crack, *wouldn't* you, Panik; because it's worked for you before. Winning through intimidation, *not* through skill..
Panik: You mock my *skill*?! My skill is what's defeating you!!.
Yugi (Yami): You *think* you're winning, that your tactics are taking me by surprise. But I saw your strategy the minute I saw what kind of man you are. .
Panik: You're talking nonsense!.
Yugi (Yami): I knew you would use Chaos Shield. Cowardly bullies like you always try to hide behind *something*..
Panik: Shut up! .
Yugi (Yami): The truth hurts, doesn't it, Panik? .
Panik: I will burn you to a cinder!.
Yugi (Yami): That would *prove* you're a coward! If you're not afraid, then you should stop hiding and play this game with honor-- Or I will rip your pathetic *fearsome* facade away!.
Panik: You bluff!.
Yugi (Yami): There's only one way you'll know for sure; play out this game..
Panik: Rrrgggghhh....
Yugi (Yami): After all, we'll know-- in two turns..
Yugi (Yami): Can you *last*? Just two turns! Do you have the *courage*?.
Panik: *Do I have the courage*!! Rrrghhh, Panik fears no duelist! I will crush your spirit, and wipe out your lifepoints!.
Mai: Boy, Yugi really shook Panik up. Psychology is half the game..
Yugi (Yami): And now, it's my turn... (draw) And my card is Gaia, the Fierce Knight! .
Gaia the Fierce Knight 2300/2100/L7/earth.
Panik: Idiot! Do you really think a monster with attack power that weak can break through my Chaos Shield?!.
Yugi (Yami): Maybe not by himself, but I also have a magic card. .
Panik: Hunh...?.
Yugi (Yami): Read it and weep!.
Panik: A "Polymerization" card!!.
Yugi (Yami): And with *this* card... I combine them to create, Gaia the Dragon Champion!.
Gaia the Dragon Champion 2600/2100//.
Yugi (Yami): Now, my combo creature's attack power is raised to twenty-six hundred!.
Panik: The Dragon Champion...?!.
Yugi (Yami): My turn's over; but *you're* finished as well..
Panik (think): Finished! What's he mean by that?! He knows that even with an attack power of twenty-six hundred, the Dragon Champion's still not strong enough to break through the Chaos Shield! There's got to be *more* to his plan than that. (aloud) Hm! Ah, perfect!.
Yugi (Yami): Mm?.
Panik: Metal Guardian in defense mode!.
Metal Guardian 1150/2150/L5/dark.
Panik: He will further shield my creatures, and the field power bonus raises his defense power to twenty-seven ninety-five! .
Yugi (Yami): Hmph. It figures; you're *cowering* again..
Panik: Insolent dog!.
Yugi (Yami): Your *strategy* is nothing but putting up defenses. You're showing how *weak* you are!.
Panik: Silence! In the next turn the Swords of Light will be extinguished! Then I'll hit you with everything at once!.
Yugi (Yami): It'll be too late. I've already led you deep into my trap. .
Panik: What?!.
Yugi (Yami): The stronger you make your defenses, the more you lock yourself into defeat. .
Panik: That's a joke! You're nothing but talk!.
Yugi (Yami): The time for talk is over. (holds up one finger) *That* was your last turn. Uuaagh! The end is now!.
Yugi (Yami): Catapult Turtle! .
Catapult Turtle 1000/2000/L5/water.
Yugi (Yami): Slow and steady wins the *duel*, Panik,  for I can use the Turtle's catapult to launch Gaia the Dragon Champion, and shatter your defenses! .
Panik: Aaagh...!.
Yugi (Yami): Catapult launch raises Gaia, the Dragon Champion's attack power all the way up-- to thirty-two hundred! You weren't expecting *that*, were you..
Panik: My monsters' defense power is still much too strong for you. Ha! Protected as they are by the Chaos Shield, you still can't touch them! You can only watch helplessly as they prepare to assault you next turn! Hahahahah!.
Yugi (Yami): Who said *anything* about attacking your *monsters*? What I'm attacking is-- the Castle!.
Panik: You fool! My Castle is *still* unassailable!.
Yugi (Yami): We'll see about that! Turtle, catapult-launch my Dragon Champion! .
Panik: Uuuggghhhhh....
Tristan: Whoa, Yugi flushed a lotta points with that maneuver!.
Bakura: I hope this works..
Joey: It *has* to work!.
Téa: I can't see a thing... wait....
Panik: Uggh...!.
Téa: No! It's still floating!.
Panik: Hahahaha!.
Téa: The castle survived!.
Panik: Fool! For all your threats, my Castle is unharmed! Your worthless attack simply knocked its flotation ring off! And now that your attack has failed, I'll eliminate you once and for all!.
Panik: I'm *still standing*, Yugi! My monsters are still contained and protected within the Chaos Shield. When this turn is over, the paralyzing effects of your Swords of Revealing Light will vanish!  Then on my turn I'll attack you will all of my monsters, and wipe you out forever! .
Yugi (Yami): Mmm. There *is* no 'next turn' for you. This duel has already ended..
Panik: It's not over!.
Yugi (Yami): Doesn't it seem *strange* to you that a castle that's lost its flotation ring is somehow *still floating*?.
Panik: Huh...?.
Yugi (Yami): What if the Swords of Revealing Light had locked in place *not only* your monsters, but your castle as well! Then, what would happen *next*?.
Panik: It... *can't* be...!.
Yugi (Yami): Right now the only thing holding up your castle are the Swords of Revealing Light, and when this turn ends, each and every Sword will vanish. .
Panik: Wha...! That means...! .
Yugi (Yami): It's over! And now your world's about to come tumbling down!.
Panik: Waaaah! No!! No one defeats Panik!.
Yugi (Yami): My turn... is over..
Panik: Run, monsters! Get out of the way!!.
Yugi (Yami): It's no good; the Chaos Shield is keeping them from running anywhere. You've trapped them all inside. .
Panik: Whaaa!.
Panik: Rrgh...!.
Panik: Uuuggggghh...!.
Téa: He won!.
Joey: An' Panik's not takin' it well!.
Tristan: *I'll* say-- Panik's having a *panic attack!*.
Panik: Nobody-- beats Panik--! *Nobody!!*.
Panik (think): Look at him-- that smug little worm! Still he mocks me!.
Panik: I may not have defeated you, Yugi!! But I can still eliminate you!!!!.
Tristan: Yugi!!.
Joey: Ah!.
Joey: He's trapped by the fire, and he can't escape!!.
Panik: We'll see who's the coward now!! .
Panik: Fire! .
Téa: Yugi's going to be fried to a crisp!.
Téa: Yugi!.
Bakura: Jump out of the way!!.
Panik: You... survived...! How can this be?! It's impossible!.
Yugi (Yami): My Millennium Puzzle protects me from your cowardly assault. .
Yugi (Yami): But nothing will protect you from... *OBLIVION!*.
Téa: Yugi, you were *incredible*!.
Tristan: Your Millennium Puzzle has more power than we thought. .
Joey: Not only did it protect Yugi, but it also saved all of *us* from the flames too!.
Mai: Yugi... I don't know what to say....
Yugi (Yami): Here. These star chips are yours. .
Mai: Uh....
Yugi (Yami): They're yours. *Take* them..
Téa: Go on..
Mai: I'm sorry, but I can't accept them. I fight my own battles!.
Téa: Mai, Yugi battled for *you*. He risked his life in this duel for you. .
Mai: I-I know, but....
Joey: There's no point in arguin'; she's *way* too thickheaded. Heh...!.
Yugi (Yami): Huh?.
Joey: But, if she'd rather be booted off the island-- *I'll* take 'em! .
Mai: Rrrrgh, you think me losing all my star chips is *funny*, Joey Wheeler?!.
Joey: Heheh, I thought ya didn't *want* 'em, Mai..
Mai: Ugh!! Give 'em *back*!!.
Joey: Of *course* you can have 'em. They're *yours*..
Mai: Uh... *really*, Joey...?.
Joey: Didn't you *learn* anything from this duel? You can't always keep your defenses up, 'cause they'll just get between *you*, an' the other people who're tryin' to be your friends. So can't ya let your *shield* down? Just this... *one* time? .
Yugi (Yami): Mm?.
Mai: Mmmm....
Joey: Ha! I'm such a *sensiti-i-i-i-i-ve* guy!.
Tristan: Haha, *yeah*-- when you're not being a pain..
Téa: Which *is* most of the time....
Joey: Ah, my adorin' fans!.
Mai: Yugi, wait!.
Mai: I'll repay you for what you did today. You're the one who won these, so far as I'm concerned I still owe you. More... than I've ever owed anyone. And when we finally *do* face each other in a duel, it'll be an honorable one!.
Téa: Sounds good..
Yugi (Yami): Yes; an honorable one..
Yugi (Yami): That's a duel I'd look forward to, Mai..
Big Five (via screen): With Kaiba still reeling from his loss to Yugi, it's the perfect time to seize control and bring this company's reputation back to what it once was!.
Pegasus: *Patience*, gentlemen. Once I defeat little Yugi, Kaiba's company will become ours..
Big Five (via screen): Of course, had you disposed of Kaiba as originally promised, we would've already assumed power. But don't worry; we'll finish what you started..
Pegasus: *No*. No one is to lay even a *finger* upon Seto Kaiba..
Big Five: But, if he's able to rescue his younger brother, we'll lose our only tie to the Kaiba name!.
Pegasus: Mokuba's future role as figurehead will not be jeopardized by his older brother's presence. *Trust* me, gentlemen. I have my *own* plans for Seto Kaiba; *and* the technical knowledge he possesses..
Big Five: Heh... Don't fail us. .
Pegasus: *Gentlemen*, KaibaCorp is about to enter a new era of prosperity-- and you are all about to become *obscenely* rich! Hmm... hmhmhmhmhmhmhm....
Pegasus: As for *you*, Kaiba...  our partnership is *just* beginning! Huhahahahahahaha...!.
Kaiba (think): I can't believe all of my business associates would turn on me after a single defeat!.
Kaiba (think): Then again, losing to Yugi has shaken *my* self-confidence, too..
FlashBack Yugi (Yami): You're a good duelist, Kaiba-- but not good enough to stop Exodia! .
FlashBack Yugi (Yami): Exodia-- Obliterate!!!.
FlashBack Kaiba: Uuaaughh! .
FlashBack Yugi (Yami): You play only for *power*, Kaiba, and *that* is why you lost. But if you put your heart in the game, there's *nothing* you can't do!.
Kaiba (think): Maybe Yugi was right. But I can't start second-guessing myself *now*. Not when Pegasus has kidnapped my little brother Mokuba! No-- If I'm gonna face off against Pegasus....
Kaiba (think, VO): ... I have to rely on my *old* dueling instincts! That's the only chance I have of freeing Mokuba.  .
Mokuba vision: Big brother...!!!.
Kaiba (think): And once Mokuba is out of harm's way....
Kaiba (think): I'll unleash my wrath on the vultures who conspired to take over my company! If Pegasus thought I would just sit *idly by* as they dismantled my life's work... he was wrong..
Pegasus vision: Hmhmhmhm....
Kaiba (think): I'll see to it that they *all* regret ever crossing... Seto Kaiba. .
Yugi: Bakura! Am I seeing things, or is your Millennium Ring actually *glowing*?.
Bakura: If it's not, then we're *both* hallucinating. .
Yugi: That's kinda *spooky*, don'tcha think? The way it's pointing like that?.
Bakura: Yes... It's almost like it's being *tugged* toward the Castle..
Yugi: Pegasus' castle? Why would it do *that*?.
Bakura: I don't know, but it did the same thing the day I met you..
Bakura (VO): I had just been transferred into your school. .
- Who's the new guy?.
Teacher: Everyone, please welcome your new classmate Bakura..
FlashBack Joey: Wham! Try defendin' *this*, Yuge!.
Bakura (VO): I was watching you guys play Duel Monsters, when, suddenly....
Bakura (VO): My Ring started to glow, and pointed *directly toward your Millennium Puzzle.*.
Yugi: Wow, Bakura. Those pointers are somehow able to *zone in* on other Millennium Items!.
Bakura: But then why would it point to the castle?.
Yugi: 'Cause of what's *inside* the castle; Pegasus' Millennium Eye. That's what took my grandpa's soul..
Bakura: My, it's all kinda *scary*, eh, Yugi? Pegasus' grabbing souls with his... and I'll never forget when *mine* took us all to the Shadow Realm! .
Yugi: Mmm..
Yugi (think): Why is it the more involved I get with Pegasus and this whole tournament, the more it all seems to be connected to these Millennium Items?.
Yugi (VO): First there was Pegasus's Millennium Eye, and now Bakura's Millennium Ring..
Yugi (VO): And of course, *my* Millennium Item.  Ever since I first solved that ancient Puzzle, playing Duel Monsters has never been the same..
Yugi (think): Now, every time I duel, I can feel a strong, *courageous* presence within me. And whatever that spirit is, I pray it will help me save my grandpa. I miss 'im. I miss him so much....
Yugi: Huh?.
Pegasus (think): Kaiba's coming... (small smile) I can *sense* it!.
Bakura: Wow! Look at that, Yugi!.
Tristan: What...?!.
Joey: Ah-- *Huh*?! Wha? 'Ey!! *Some of us* are tryin' to get some shuteye here, ya insensitive *jerk*!.
Téa: What *is* that?.
Yugi and Bakura: Ah....
All: Huh...!.
Téa: It's *Kaiba*! .
Joey: What's *he* doin' here?.
Tristan: I dunno, but it looks like he means *business.*.
Kaiba: I haven't seen you since our duel, Yugi..
Yugi: Mmm-hmm. Oh! (he reaches into a pocket) Here. Your deck. I've been keeping it for you. Just... think of it as a 'thank you' for that duel you helped me win..
Kaiba: Thanks. You'll be compensated for all of your trouble..
Yugi: Huh...? *Actually*, Kaiba, I was thinking that since we're all headed for Pegasus' Castle, you could stick with us. (Kaiba stops) 'Course... heh-- you'll need some *star chips*....
Kaiba: Don't be so naive. This isn't just a *game* for me, Yugi..
Yugi: Huh?.
Kaiba: I'm going after Pegasus to save my brother; (turns) not so I can win some silly prize! (disdainfully) Have fun with your *tournament*!.
Yugi: But... Kaiba....
Joey: That snobby little...! Rrgh! .
Téa: Huh?.
Joey: 'Ey! Listen, tough-guy! I can understand you wantin' to get your little brother back an' all, but don't go thinkin' that you're the only one here with a noble cause, capiche?  We all got somethin' worth fightin' for, so if you wanna piece a' Pegasus, get in line or deal with *me*! *That's* right, hotshot, I ain't scared a' ya!.
Kaiba: Nice grip. Lemme show ya *mine.*.
Tristan and Téa: Oh...!.
Bakura: That was uncalled-for!.
Yugi: Joey!.
Joey: Ugh....
Yugi: Joey, can ya hear me? Are you all right?.
Tristan and Téa: Oh...!.
Bakura: Check his pulse, Yugi!.
Joey: Eh, relax. I'm fine..
Kaiba: Do you really think I'm gonna let you and this little tournament you're in delay me from finding Pegasus?.
Joey: Forget Pegasus! Now you got *me* to deal with, so bust out your cards and let's *get it on*!.
Téa: I can't tell if Joey's being really brave or... nuts..
Kaiba: Forget it. Why don't you go look for an opponent you can actually *beat*! Like an infant. Or a monkey..
Joey: Huh?! *Wha'd* you say?!.
Tristan (aside): That monkey thing gets him every time..
Kaiba: Hmph. I don't have time for your *nonsense*. Loser..
Joey: Go ahead an' run! Everyone *knows* you're nothin' but a washed-up has-been!! .
Yugi: Joey, be careful what you say. Kaiba may be a creep, but he's still pretty much considered the top duelist in all the world!.
Joey: Not *anymore*!.
Joey: *That's right*, tough-guy! I bet ever since Yugi mopped the *floor* wit' ya, you can't even lay a trap card without flinchin'!.
Tristan: Okay, Joey, *let it go*..
Téa: This is really the wrong guy to pick a fight with!.
Joey: Whaddaya say, money-bags? *Care to prove me wrong*?.
Kaiba: On one condition..
Joey: Huh?.
Kaiba: We play using my newest innovation in holographic duel technologies. .
Yugi (this sounds like trouble...): Whaddaya mean by *that*?.
Kaiba: It means that if Joey's really that eager to duel me, he's gonna have to do it using my latest holographic system. (He holds out the briefcase he's been carrying) It's a new high-tech dueling device that allows players the realism of arena matches in any setting..
Joey: Looks like just a regular ol' briefcase to *me*..
Kaiba: It's *in* the briefcase, you moron..
Kaiba: Its technology is unprecedented!.
Joey: Looks like a flyin' saucer. .
Kaiba: Don't be an idiot. This is the most state-of-the-art display modulator ever *built*. So if you think you have what it takes to handle it, just strap it on..
Joey: Okay, *now* what happens?.
Kaiba: First insert your dueling deck into the display drive recognizer. A lifepoint count will light up and keep score for you the entire match..
Kaiba: Then choose a card to play and set it on the digital card reader. I think the rest will explain itself..
Joey: Cool..
Kaiba: All set? Then let's *duel*! .
Joey: You got it!.
Kaiba: Now, brace yourself-- for my Battle Ox!.
Tristan: Whoa, check out all those lights! 'S like *raining glitter*!.
Téa: Yeah-- it's like something from an enchanted dream!.
Battle Ox ///.
Téa: Eee! Or a *nightmare*!.
Joey: Whoa...! .
Yugi: No *way*! *That's* a hologram?!.
Kaiba: A hologram of unprecedented realism. It breathes, it snarls; my new Dueling Disk technology even simulates its *odor*..
Joey: You're tellin' *me*; that thing really *stinks*! Good thing he won't be around for much longer!.
Joey: A-a-alrighty-- here goes nothin'! .
Joey: Go, Armored Lizard!!.
Armored Lizard ///.
Kaiba: Go, Battle Ox! Axe Slam attack!.
Joey: Yess! He withstood your attack!.
Kaiba: Oh, *did* he? Look again!.
Joey: O-o-kay, that's real enough for *me*...!.
Joey: I can't believe it! That ugly overgrown ox-- he cut my lizard in half! .
Kaiba: This new technology isn't for the faint of heart, Joey. It's intended to force duelists to think on their feet. If it's too much for you, maybe you should give up now..
Joey: Fa-a-at chance! Don't you worry, Kaiba, I'm a quick learner! Watch! .
Joey: Set the card-- spin the disk-- a-a-a-and, bingo!.
Flame Swordsman ///.
Joey: The Flame Swordsman, ready to slaughter that sirloin a' yours! Attack! Flamin' Sword a' Battle!.
Yugi: But Joey-- the Battle Ox is resistant to all Fire-type creatures...!.
Joey: *Now* he tells me...!.
Kaiba: Why am I not surprised that you'd make such an amateur mistake? Maybe from now on you oughta let Yugi pick *all* of your moves for you. Or better *yet*, why don't *I* teach you some of the advanced moves of the game *the hard way*! Mystic Horseman and Battle Ox! Merge into-- Rabid Horseman! .
Rabid Horseman ///.
Joey: Ya think I'm afraid a' that deformed *pony*? *I'll* show ya somethin' that you should be afraid of! Swamp Battleguard, attack!.
Swamp Battleguard ///.
Joey: Axe Raider, avenge my Battleguard!.
Axe Raider ///.
Joey: Go, Battle Steer!.
Battle Steer ///.
Joey: Euh, Garoozis?.
Garoozis ///.
Joey: Okay, uh, let's see here, Smashing Rock...? Aww!.
Smashing Rock ///.
Joey: Uhhh, Rude Kaiser!.
Kaiba: Heheheheheheh. That's right, Joey; fall to the dirt like a whimpering *dog*!.
Joey (think): Man, it took *Exodia* for even *Yugi* to beat this guy! I need to come up with a kick-butt card--.
Téa: Come on, Joey! .
Joey: Ah?.
Téa: You're the best at finding ways to come back from behind!.
Bakura: She's right, Joey! .
Tristan: Now, get up-- no *way* Kaiba gets away with callin' you a canine!.
Joey: You're right, Tristan; no one calls *me* a whimperin' dog, and once he sees what I got in store for 'im, *he's* gonna be the one in the dirt! Check this out-- Red-Eyes Black Dragon!.
Red-Eyes B. Dragon ///.
Téa: Joey's best card! .
Tristan: Kaiba's in big trouble now!.
Joey: Inferno-o-o-o Fire Blast!!.
Joey: Take *that*!.
Kaiba: It's just like a novice to rejoice when there's no reason to celebrate. True, the round may be yours, but the duel is about to become mine!.
Joey: Say *what*?!.
Kaiba: Your Red-Eyes is a powerful dragon, but his ferocity pales in comparison to *my* beast..
Kaiba: The legendary Blue-Eyes White Dragon!!.
Blue-Eyes White Dragon ///.
Joey: Ahh...! .
Kaiba: Blue-Eyes White Dragon! White Lightning attack, now!!!!.
Joey: Aaaaaggggghhh...!!!.
Joey: No! I lost!.
Kaiba: That's right, Joey, stay down. .
Kaiba: Stay down like the sniveling, defeated dog I've turned you into..
Yugi: Are you all right, Joey?.
Téa (gently): It's okay, kiddo..
Kaiba: *I'd* say my Duel Disk system has proven quite effective. Not only did its stunning realism jar Joey into complete and utter submission, but *just look at him*. He's moping like a frightened dog with his tail between his legs... which is *exactly* how I intend to leave Pegasus..
Yugi: But this is *Joey*!.
Téa: Yeah, you *jerk*! Did you have to take his confidence away *with* his dragon? Joey was just starting to believe in himself as a duelist!.
Yugi: That's right. Beating him doesn't give you the right to *humiliate* him!.
Joey: Quiet, Yugi!  Don't give that creep the satisfaction!.
Kaiba: Huh! Look kid, d'you honestly believe that if you were dueling Pegasus, he would've been any more *merciful* with you than I was? I understand that the *Heart of the Cards* is a powerful philosophy, and that it all works *well* for you, but I need to duel my own way now! I can't risk trying something new, and maybe *Joey* shouldn't either, unless he *likes* life as a *dog*-- scrounging on the scraps of past victories and begging for mercy from true duelists!.
Yugi: Please, *Kaiba*. That's just *not true*. And you know it..
Kaiba: Oh, *yeah*? Well that's the kind of attitude you have to take if you wanna stand a *chance* against Maximillion Pegasus!.
Kaiba (VO): You don't understand, Yugi. This is the man who *created* Duel Monsters. He has every card that's ever been made at his disposal; he's mastered every strategy that's ever been played! .
Kaiba: Pegasus always makes sure that he has every possible advantage working in his favor; if I'm to stand *any* chance against him at *all*, I'll have to play by my *own* *ruthless rules*... not his. .
Kaiba: *Open your eyes*! Even with your prodigious talents, Yugi, you'll be defeated like all the others; because when Pegasus duels, he uses much more than mere skill. .
Kaiba: I've seen him use a magic that's stronger than *any* card!.
Kaiba (VO): It was at the Intercontinental Tournament, in New York City. I had been invited as Pegasus's guest of honor..
Kaiba (VO): A hotshot duelist called Bandit Keith had made it to the final match. He was playing well, but I could see that Pegasus was still just toying with him. Of course, Keith had *no idea*..
FlashBack Bandit Keith: Heheh. I wish you could see the expression on your face, Pegasus. It's *priceless*. Tell you what-- if you ask nice, I'll finish you fast! .
FlashBack Sam: Boy! I wanna be a duelist like *him*!.
FlashBack Bandit Keith: Heh! *This* card *clinches* it for me! Hmph! Any final words, *cutie-pie*? .
(Pegasus doesn't reply, still with that calculating smile.) .
FlashBack Bandit Keith: Hey-- I'm talkin' to *you*!.
(From the sidelines, Kaiba, watching closely, is quietly intent on this.) .
Kaiba (VO): Pegasus just stared straight into Keith's eyes, with unnerving confidence. Then he scribbled something on a piece of paper and called over some kid from the crowd. .
FlashBack Sam: Huh...?.
FlashBack Bandit Keith: Hey whadda you *doin*!! Askin' for help's *illegal*!.
FlashBack Pegasus: I don't *need* help. A *child* could defeat *you*, Bandit Keith, and I'm going to prove it!.
FlashBack Sam: But I just started to learn how to play last week..
FlashBack Pegasus: Just follow these instructions and you'll win..
FlashBack Bandit Keith (think): What's he up to?!.
FlashBack Pegasus: Hello, Kaiba. Ah... I do hope you're enjoying the tournament so far. Oh, I know it must seem *so crude* to you. Not at all like the holographic dueling stations your company is developing, *eh*, Kaiba?.
FlashBack Bandit Keith (think): If Pegasus thinks he's gonna throw of *my* game with his lame theatrics, he's *dead wrong*! Hnh. I've got this match *in the bag*! (aloud) Garnecia Elefantis!.
Garnecia Elefantis 2400/2000/L7/earth  .
FlashBack Sam: Good card. But the note says when you play that, I should play this one in attack mode..
Flying Elephant 1850/1500/L4/wind FlashBack Bandit Keith: No way!!!!.
FlashBack Sam: Uh, I think I just took all your lifepoints..
FlashBack Bandit Keith: What?! You little snot-nosed brat, there is *no way* you coulda known I was gonna play that card! Gimme that!!.
FlashBack Bandit Keith: Ugh... Huh... It's all here. The card I played, how to beat it-- *everything*...!.
FlashBack Kaiba: Huh...?.
FlashBack Pegasus: Sam is the winner!.
FlashBack Kaiba: Ah....
Kaiba: I still don't know how he did it. I only hope that my new Duel Disk system will give me the edge I need to beat 'im once and for all..
Yugi: That story....
Yugi (VO): It reminds me of when *I* faced Pegasus..
FlashBack Pegasus: Ah, I see you're about to use a Koumori Dragon. .
FlashBack Yugi (Yami): *What*?.
FlashBack Pegasus: I know every move you'll make, before you can even *make it*!.
Yugi: It was like Pegasus was able to see all my cards... But *Kaiba*, that's still no excuse to take it out on *us* and turn Joey into your new system's guinea pig! .
Kaiba: Perhaps. But that system could be my only way to beat Pegasus, so I had to test it! This is *war* for me, Yugi; your friend was a casualty! .
Yugi: Kaiba! We may not agree with each other's methods, but at least we both understand that Pegasus *must be stopped*..
Yugi: ...I hope you succeed in rescuing your brother..
Kaiba: And I hope you succeed in your ventures. Let's just hope our paths don't cross again before this is all over. .
Pegasus: Hmhmhmhmhmhm. I can sense you, Kaiba! Heheheheheh. But are you hunting for *me*, or am *I* hunting *you*? Hmhmhm....
Dream Joey: Kaiba! Call off your dragon-- I give! I *give*! .
Dream Kaiba: Poor, scared Joey. He calls himself a duelist but he's just a little puppy dog, cringing in fear. .
Dream Joey (indignant): I'm not scared a' you. .
Dream Kaiba: Bad dog! Don't contradict your master!.
Dream Joey: Rrrgh, you're not my--.
Dream Kaiba: Quiet! Sit! .
Dream Kaiba: Sit at your master's feet-- where you belong!.
Joey: Unh..? Huh!.
Joey: A dream...!.
Joey: Rrrrrgghhh!! Kaiba, we'll see who eats the dog chow on *this* island! Hrrgh, everybody, *wake up*!!.
Yugi: Joey, what's wrong? .
Bakura: What is it, Joey?.
Joey: Ahh, *nothin's* wrong! It's just a *brand new day a' the tournament.* And I'm hot to find us a duel! .
Tristan: Well ya don't have to *yell* about it..
Téa: Hey, guys. What's all the commotion?.
Yugi: G'morning, Téa..
Joey: Where's Mai? Isn't she with ya?.
Téa: She said she had to go. And to give you this note, Yugi. .
Mai (VO): I owe you eight star chips. See ya 'round! Mai..
Tristan: Kiss *those* chips goodbye..
Yugi: I dunno; maybe we really *can* trust Mai. .
Joey: And if not... well, we're still the team supreme, right?!.
Everyone: Right! .
Joey: Okay, then-- move out!.
Bakura: I wonder how many duelists there are left on the island?.
Joey: They shipped a couple dozen home yesterday..
Téa: And I bet even *more* have been eliminated by now..
Yugi: And some of them were really good players with powerful cards, too! We could be next..
Tristan: Not a *chance*, Yuge. Those other guys just wanted the prize. You and Joey have a lot more at stake. .
Yugi: That's true. I've gotta rescue grandpa from Pegasus, and Joey needs the prize money to help his sister. And the duelists we face today will be *even stronger*, 'cause they survived the first round. .
Joey: Even *stronger*? .
Tristan (teasing): Careful what 'cha say, Yugi, you've got little *Joey* here shakin' in his sneakers! .
Joey: What?! You think I'm a scared little puppy dog?!.
Tristan: Well if the collar *fits*....
Téa: All right, break it up!.
Joey: Hey, you just bring on any duelist-- and I'll cream 'em!.
Yugi: Right! Ya gotta believe in yourself, Joey! .
Joey: Yeah, that's right....
Bonz: ...'Cause *nobody else* does..
Bonz: I want *that* one..
Zigor: If you like 'em tall, skinny, an' stupid, Bonz, that geekwad sure fits the bill!.
Syd: Oh yeah, you'll *demolish* 'im!.
Syd: So, who are they, anyway?.
Zigor: Will ya just keep your shirt on, Syd? I'm tryin' to see if I can get a tighter focus on 'em..
Joey: ...they may as well....
Syd: Dunno who the others are, but I think that little runt is that *Yugi* kid. .
Zigor: Yugi? He's the one who beat Kaiba..
Bonz: *Really*?.
Syd: We better tell the boss about *this*, Zigor..
Zigor: Right on. .
Bandit Keith: All right, *spit it out*! .
Zigor: We found two duelists..
Syd: One's just a *stupid git*--.
Bonz: But the other one is a *good* duelist..
Bonz: That kid's name is Yugi, right?.
Zigor: He's the kid who beat Kaiba! Everybody figures 'im to make it all the way to Pegasus's castle!.
Bandit Keith: Yugi, huh? Tch, yeah, I heard a' him.  He's supposed to be a tough little *squirt*, that is if you believe in his reputation..
Bonz: Huh?.
Zigor: Yeah... yeah! We never seen 'im duel! How d' we know how good Yugi really *is*? .
Syd: Right! Nobody's goin' to the castle 'cept us, 'cause we're teamed up with the most *brilliant bloomin' duelist* on the whole island! .
Bandit Keith: That's right. So if you *bums* wanna win this tournament, you'll keep your traps *shut*-- (takes off his sunglasses) You'll keep *cool*, and you'll let Bandit Keith do all your thinkin' *for* ya!.
Zigor: Unh, no argument from me, boss! You got all the brains-- I'm jus' da muscle!.
Syd: And we'll hammer any blinkin' duelist who gets in our way! .
Zigor: Heh, an' if....
Bandit Keith (think): Ya hear that, Pegasus?! Soon it'll be payback time!.
Bandit Keith (think, VO): Payback for the way you humiliated me at the Duel Monsters Intercontinental Championship. .
Bandit Keith (think, VO): It had all come down to you against me, and I had you *right where I wanted you*. .
FlashBack Bandit Keith: Ha. Any *final words*, mullet-head? .
Bandit Keith (VO): I was *sure* I was about to win; when you just scribbled some notes  and called over a kid from the audience..
FlashBack Bandit Keith: Hey, whadda you *doin'*?! Askin' for help's illegal!.
FlashBack Pegasus: I don't *need* *help*; a *child* could defeat you, Bandit Keith! And I'm going to prove it. Just follow these instructions, and you'll win..
Bandit Keith (VO): I didn't know *what* to make of it! Were you just tryin' to psych me out? Or didja *chicken* out? Either way it was *fine by me*, so long as *I* took home the prize money!.
FlashBack Bandit Keith: Okay, punk-- *beat this*!.
Garnecia Elefantis 2400/2000/L7/earth.
FlashBack Sam (the kid): Good card. But the note says when you play that, I should play this one in attack mode. .
Flying Elephant 1850/1500/L4/wind.
FlashBack Bandit Keith: *No way*!!!.
FlashBack Sam: Uhh, I think I just took all your lifepoints..
FlashBack Bandit Keith: What?! You little snot-nosed brat, there's *no way* you could've known I was gonna play that card! Gimme that!!.
FlashBack Sam: Huh?.
FlashBack Bandit Keith: It's all here...! The card I played, how to beat it, *everything*!!.
FlashBack Pegasus: Sam is the winner!.
FlashBack Bandit Keith (echoing): No-o-o-o-o-o!!!.
Bandit Keith (think): You may've defeated me, Pegasus-- *cheated* me-- but *nobody* makes a fool outta Bandit Keith!!  .
Bandit Keith: Now-- you said you found *two* duelists?.
Zigor: Yeah. Yugi an' some dweeb named Joey. .
Bandit Keith: Good-- we'll take the *dweeb* out first. .
Joey: Did you hear that? I think we're bein' followed..
Téa: *I* think you're getting a little paranoid, Joey..
Tristan: You've been actin' *hyper* ever since you woke up this morning. *Man*, what the heck is eating you, anyway?.
Joey: I'm tellin' ya-- somebody's stalkin' us!.
Tristan: Where're you going?.
Joey: To stalk *them*!.
Bonz: B-boss, where're we headed?.
Bandit Keith: To a hidden arena. .
Bonz: In a c-cave?.
Bonz: Wha-a-a-a-a!.
Bandit Keith: You oughta feel *right at home* down here, Bonz, it's dark, and dank, and really *creepy*, just like you are. Your deck, uh... you *did* load it up mostly with zombie cards, didn'tcha?  .
Bonz: Uhh, yeah. .
Bandit Keith: Lemme see what'cha got there. .
Bandit Keith: Good-- but I think you could use a little more *brute force*. .
Bonz: But where could I find--.
Bandit Keith: Don't you worry, kid..
Bandit Keith: I got all the power you need right here to build the strongest zombie deck in Duel Monsters *history*!.
Bandit Keith: It's time we moved on to the *graveyard*..
Bonz: The g-graveyard?!.
Bandit Keith: It's a perfect arena for you, Bonz. And with all these new zombie cards, you just can't lose!.
Bonz: Heheh, thanks, boss. *And* you can bet that I won't let you down!.
Bandit Keith: You *better* not, or you're gonna find yourself in a world of *hurt*! You wouldn't want that now, *wouldja*!.
Bandit Keith: What're you afraid of? Some musty old skull? .
Bonz: Y-yeah..
Bandit Keith: Gimme a break, *your* face is scarier than *this* old thing.  .
Bonz: Uh, b-boss? Wait for me!.
Joey: Maybe Téa was right. I guess, all I heard was the waterfall. .
Joey: Huh? .
Joey: Can I help you?.
Zigor: Heheheheheh....
Zigor: Wake up, dweeb!.
Joey: Wha- *you*!! What? Where am I? .
Zigor: Huhuhuh, the boss wants you-- up!.
Joey: What *is* this place?!.
Bandit Keith: Hahahahahah....
Joey: Yah! A tombstone?!.
Bonz: Whoo-oo-oo-oo-ooo...! Welcome, duelist, to the arena of lost souls! .
Joey: Whaa-aa-aa-aa-aaahh!.
Bonz: Abandon hope-- for no duelist gets out of here ali-i-i-ive! .
Joey: He-e-elp, a ghost!! Aaaaahhh!.
Yugi: Joey's been gone an awfully long time..
Téa: You don't suppose he got lost?.
Yugi: No way. But he *could've* been challenged to a duel..
Tristan: I bet that's it. I must've got on his case a little too hard about bein' scared; so now he's gone off to fight a duel all by himself..
Bakura: Okay, let's split up and try to find him..
Tristan: Right. Yugi and Téa, you head that way; Bakura an' I will go this way. .
Yugi, Téa, Bakura: Okay!.
Bonz (sinister voice): Prepare for your final duel! This arena will be your graveyard..
Zigor (aside): Huh, *spook-ay!* .
Syd (aside): Spot on, mate. He's got the dweeb scared stiff. .
Zigor: I don't believe it! Looks like the guy fainted on his feet! Huhuhuhuh!.
Bandit Keith: Yeah-- so do somethin', Zigor! Get busy an' wake 'im up! .
Zigor: You heard 'im, dweeb, rise an' shine!.
Bonz (spooky voice): Heheh. The ghosts of the dead are all around you, Joey! There's no way to escape from your fear! .
Joey: Huh? Who *says* I'm scared? .
Bonz (spooky voice): You can't hide the truth from the spirits, Joey. Hoohaha! They see you frozen in fear! .
Joey: Okay, I *was* afraid; but not 'cause a' the graveyard or your ooga-booga rap, it's your creepy *face* that gave me the willies!! .
Bandit Keith: Ahaha! You gotta admit, he's got a point, Bonz!.
Zigor: Yeah, you even spook *me* out, Bonz, and I'm on *your* side!.
Bonz: Wel-l-l, if you're on my side, then *stop laughing at me*! (to Joey) So are we gonna duel or just stand around talking! Lay down your star chips now! .
Joey: Rrgh. Hey, I never even *agreed* to this duel..
Bandit Keith: Tough luck! You haven't got any *choice*, *dweeb*. .
Joey: Ggnnghh.. There has to be some way outta this....
Bandit Keith: Huh? You wanna *way out*? Well hand over all your star chips and crawl out like a scared little *puppy dog*. .
Syd: Bad doggy!.
Joey (mutters): *Puppy dog*?.
Dream Kaiba: Sit at your master's feet,  where you belong!.
Joey (mutters): If I run from *this* I really *will* be a scared little puppy dog. (aloud) So I'll just have to beat'cha! Four star chips! .
Zigor: Heh! Nice goin', boss, he fell for it! Heheh! .
Joey and Bonz: Let's duel!.
Zigor (calls): Put 'im away quick, Bonz! Send 'im straight to the grave with a zombie card!.
Bonz: Heh, yeah!.
Joey: A *zombie* card? Yikes. *Now* I get what he's up to. .
Bonz: You don't stand a chance. This arena's one big graveyard field; and all my zombie cards get a field power bonus here..
Tristan: Joey?!.
Bakura: Joey!.
Tristan: There's no sign of 'im *anywhere*! .
Bakura: Hey, let's look over *that* way!.
Yugi: Joey?.
Téa: Joey!.
Yugi: He's not here..
Téa: Where could he *be*? If he were fighting a duel, I'm sure that we'd see the arena. .
Yugi: Joey's just *vanished*. I'm *worried*, Téa..
Bonz: Huhuhuhuheheheh... heheheh... here goes...! My zombie card--.
Bandit Keith: Not so fast, squirt. Hold that card for *now*. Play the one on the *far left* instead..
Bonz: P-play the one on the *left*, boss?.
Bonz: But that card is Zanki. Zanki's not a zombie card at all!.
Bandit Keith: Ya needed some raw muscle, so I slipped it into your deck, Bonz!.
Bonz: But, if it's not a zombie card it won't get the field power bonus from the graveyard!.
Bandit Keith: Don't argue with me, squirt, just do what I tell ya..
Bonz: But--.
Zigor: Play the card; Bandit Keith won't steer ya wrong..
Syd: Right, right!.
Zigor: How could any of us have gotten this far without following all his advice!.
Syd: Right, yeah, right!.
Joey What is this-- duelin' by committee?! Are ya gonna play the card or aren't ya?!.
Bonz: Right, boss. *Whatever you say*. Zanki-- in attack mode!.
Zanki 1500/1700//earth .
Joey: *This'll* put a dent in Zanki's armor! .
Axe Raider 1700/1150//.
Joey: Go, Axe Raider! Attack! Wind Blades!.
Joey: All right! So much for your armored warrior!.
Bonz: He wiped me out! Ohh....
Bandit Keith: Heheh. *Looks* that way. .
Bonz: So *why did you make me play that lame card*? If that had been one of my zombie cards, I could've *clobbered* 'im! .
Joey: *Bonz*! Where's all your spooky chatter now, ya little creep! Play your next card-- whatever it is, I'm ready! .
Bonz (mutters): Ohh, I have to play a zombie card....
Bandit Keith: No, not *that* one, Bonz. Second card to the left..
Bonz: Huh? The Crawling Dragon? (think) *This* isn't a zombie card *either*! As soon as I play it, he'll *obliterate* me, just like last time! .
Bandit Keith: Look, I *know* ya don't like it. Just be *patient*, Bonz, we're workin' on a *strategy* here. Remember, no duelist has ever beaten Bandit Keith without cheatin'. .
Bonz (resentfully, mutters): Yeah... until now. (aloud) Defense mode!.
Joey: Runnin' from me already, skullface? You're not so scary after all, huh! Go-o-o, Axe Raider! Slice 'em an' dice 'em!.
Crawling Dragon ///.
Bonz: Uggghhh...!.
Joey: I win!.
Bandit Keith: Now play the card that's on the far right! .
Bandit Keith: You heard me, and don't use defense mode this time! If the dweeb can't see your monster he might just hesitate and wait to attack. .
Bonz: Ohh....
Bandit Keith: Ya don't wanna trust me, Bonz, I'll keep my advice to myself-- it's up to you..
Bonz: Umm... Crass Clown, in attack mode!.
Crass Clown 1350/1400//dark.
Crass Clown: Eyahahahahahahahaha!.
Joey: Is that the best you've got?!  Flame Swordsman!.
Flame Swordsman 1800/1600//.
Joey and Bonz: Let's duel!!.
Joey: Flaming Sword of Battle!.
Joey: Too bad. One Crass Clown goin' down..
Bonz: Ohh....
Joey (think): Creep show's *scared*. I got 'im on the run. An' I plan to *keep* 'im that way. There's way too much ridin' on this duel for me to blow it..
Joey: My sister Serenity's countin' on me. So watch out, skullface-- ya *better* be scared-- 'cause this little *puppy dog* is gonna chase *your* bony butt right outta your own graveyard! .
Bonz (to Keith): *Now* what?.
Bandit Keith: Just relax. You've already got this duel *won*, Bonz!.
Joey: What's the problem, Bonz, can't fight this duel on your own?! Maybe your *coach* wants to take me on, I'll cream *him too*!.
Bandit Keith: Oh, yeah?  Looks like you need a lesson in *strategy*, *dweeb*! .
Joey: Huh?.
Bonz: ...Oh. Wow. I had *totally forgotten* about this magic card, boss! *Now* I understand. .
Bandit Keith: Lay it down, Bonz, play your trump card!! .
Bonz: You're finished!! This magic card (sic) is unstoppable! The "Call of the Haunted"!.
Joey: The Call of the Haunted?.
Bandit Keith: It brings all of the monsters you destroyed back from the grave. .
Bonz: But they come back as zombies, with the power of immortality! .
Joey: Uhh..!.
Joey: Ohh, no, oh no!.
Téa: Tristan, look. .
Tristan: Hey, that's *Joey's* wallet!.
Téa: With a picture of his sister, Serenity. .
Tristan: Joey would *never* be careless enough to lose that. His sister means more to him than anything..
Tristan: This is starting to smell like foul play. .
Téa: Look over there!.
Tristan: A cave. I don't like the look a' this. .
Yugi: Neither do I!.
Tristan: What *is* this place?.
Yugi: Be careful. Could be some kind of trap..
Téa: What's up with those coffins?.
Bakura: Beats *me*. Who'd leave them just *standing* here?.
Téa: Yeah....
Yugi: I wouldn't touch those, guys..
Tristan: Be careful..
Téa: Don't be silly! It's just a wooden b- uh....
Téa: Wha...? Aaah!.
Tristan: That Pegasus has sure got a sick sense of humor..
Yugi: You said it, Tristan..
Dragon Zombie 1600/0//.
Clown Zombie 1350/0//.
Armored Zombie 1500/0//.
Joey: Your monsters are back...! .
Bonz: Heheh. Call of the Haunted brought all of them back from the grave, and they're zombies now!.
Joey: They're *zombies*...?!.
Bonz: And as zombies, they all gain a field power bonus from this *graveyard* field..
Bonz: Dragon Zombie, attack the Axe Raider! .
Joey: Axe Raider, *bash* that lizard!.
Joey: Oh, no! Direct hit, and the zombie dragon recovered! .
Bandit Keith: Heheheheheh! They're *zombies* now, dweeb, ya can't destroy 'em with an axe!.
Joey: Wha- oh, no!.
Bonz: Hoohoohahahaha! Oh, yes! Dragon zombie, destroy Axe Raider! Deadly Zombie Breath! .
Bonz: One down-- and one to go. .
Joey: Huh?.
Bonz: Now your *puny Swordsman* is outnumbered, *three*-- to one! .
Joey: Oh, man!  *Now* what'm I gonna do?! Nothin' can kill those monsters! I blew it...! I'm dead meat.
Bonz: You've had it, duelist. Face it; all my monsters you thought you'd killed, have risen from the grave  as invincible zombies that can't be destroyed!.
Bonz: And as zombies, they all gain a field power bonus from the *graveyard*!.
Joey: Nnngh....
Bonz: Come on, play your next card, Joey!.
Joey: This one. Garoozis..
Garoozis 1800/1500//.
Joey: Go, with Five Slash Strike!.
Bandit Keith: Heheheheh....
Joey: Yes! Adios, you Clown Zombie!.
Bonz: Not quite! .
Joey: Huh?.
Bonz: I tried to tell you, *dweeb*; forgot my magic card? "Call of the Haunted" is still in pla-a-ay!.
Joey: Your Clown's come back to life!.
Bonz: Heheh, and that's not all! Each and every time a zombie monster is killed, it will come back to life even stronger, and more deadly than before! .
Joey: Wha?!.
Bonz: The Clown Zombie's attack power was originally thirteen-fifty. (1350) But it gains a thirty-percent field power bonus, from the graveyard field; so now it's seventeen-fifty-five. (1755) And after being brought back to life,  it gets *another* ten-percent. (1890) Do the math, peabrain! He's *stronger than Garoozis*!!.
Joey: He *can't* be--!.
Bonz: Clown Zombie! Flame Dagger Acrobatic Attack!.
Tristan: Still no sign a' Joey..
Yugi: Yeah. .
Tristan: Hey-- where's Bakura? .
Yugi and Téa: Huh?.
Téa: We didn't take any *turns*; so where could he have gone?.
Yugi: I dunno, Téa..
Bakura: Aa-aa-aagh!!.
Yugi: Did you hear that?.
Téa: Sounds like Bakura!.
Tristan (calls): Bakura! This way!.
Bakura: Aa-aa-aagh!! Help me!!!.
Bakura: Help! Get this thing off of me!!.
Tristan: From now on, don't go pickin' up any hitchhikers!.
Téa (tongue sticking out): Ith it safe to open my eyth now?.
Yugi: You gave us all quite a scare with that skeleton, Bakura. .
Bakura: Sorry. .
Tristan: Never mind *that*. Because now we've got *another* problem.  Which way do we go now?.
Tristan: Anybody got any ideas?.
Téa (sarcastic): Gee-- both ways look *so* inviting..
Tristan: Yeah, well, if Joey got *invited* down one a' those tunnels, then we need to figure out which one! .
Yugi: Tristan's right. We need to find Joey, *now*. .
Téa, Bakura, Tristan: Yeah!.
Bakura: Hey-- my foot!.
Tristan: What is that sound?.
Bakura: I stepped on a switch, or something--.
Yugi: Quiet now!.
Bakura: Oh!.
Tristan: ...Listen. Now the sound's getting *louder*..
Téa: I think it's coming this way. .
Yugi: Yeah, but just *what's* coming this way?.
Bakura: Oh, dear...!!.
Bakura (overlapping): Do hurry! Do hurry!.
Téa: Why is that boulder chasing us?!.
Tristan: 'Cause we're *downhill*! .
Bakura: I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry...!!.
Yugi: It got Bakura!! .
Téa (wails): Oh no!!!.
Tristan: Don't look back! Ugh! Ugh! Keep running, or it's-- .
Tristan: Oh no, it's a *dead end*!!.
Tristan: Uagh, we're trapped, it's a *dead end*! .
Tristan: Since there's nowhere to run, *I'm gonna fight*!!.
Yugi: Tristan, you can't punch out--.
Téa: --A boulder!!.
Tristan: I'm gonna *try*! Hyaaaaaahhh!!.
Tristan: ...Huh? A *balloon*...?.
Yugi: Yeah-- and that's a *speaker*..
Yugi: Somebody wired that thing for sound, and *I'm betting it was Pegasus*!.
Téa: Are you okay? Bakura? .
Yugi: Pegasus spared no expense to scare us half to death!.
Joey (think): This is a catastrophe! I smack down those zombies, and they just come back even nastier than before! Man, oh, *man*-- I don't know how I can *win* this duel!.
Bandit Keith: Heh... Had enough yet, *dweeb*? I toldya that there's no way to *beat* Bandit Keith..
Zigor: Yeah, Bandit Keith's the best there is..
Syd: You can leave your star chips at the door!.
(Joey clenches his teeth, looking down at his four wagered star chips on the console.) .
Joey (think): If I lose these chips, I get axed from the tournament!.
Joey (think, VO): Last time I dueled, Kaiba beat me pretty bad. Maybe I *should* just *give up*....
Joey: No way, man! I'm not a scared little puppy! And for Serenity's sake, I gotta stay in the game! I have to trust in the cards-- and in *myself*. .
Joey (think): Huh?! Time Wizard!.
Joey (think, VO): This card I got from Yugi has pulled my rump outta the fire before, like in my duels with Mai and Rex Raptor. When I fought Rex, it even fossilized his dinosaur!.
Joey (think): Maybe it'll help me again-- yeah... maybe he can blow those zombies away! What've I got to lose! (aloud) I play, Time Wizard!.
Time Wizard 500///.
Bandit Keith (think): *Time Wizard*! Apparently the dweeb's smarter than I thought! His Time Magic could age Bonz's zombies *right into the dust*!.
Joey: Spin, Time Roulette!.
Bonz: Boss, help me!.
Bandit Keith: Don't worry--  don't you know Time Roulette is totally a game of chance, Bonz? It's *all a matter of luck*-- so if yours is better, you won't be wiped out, see? .
Bonz: Aahh!.
Joey (mutters): C'mon Time Wizard, you can do this....
Bonz: No you can't, no you can't, no you can't, no you can't....
Joey: This is it...!.
Bonz: Uuuuhh...!.
Joey: What?! No way!.
Bonz: Boss, I won!.
Bandit Keith: You're really gonna dig what happens *next*, Bonz. Now his Time Wizard and Flame Swordsman will vanish into a time warp in the sky!.
Joey: No...! Don't go!.
Bandit Keith: And that's not all-- half the attack power of those monsters gets deducted from Joey's lifepoints!.
Bonz: Hoohoohaha! Want me to play a card, or would you rather defeat *yourself*! .
Joey (mutters): I didn't know that I'd take this big a hit  if I lost the spin at Time Roulette....
Bonz: *Poor Joey*. I'll give you a free turn; throw my zombies another tasty morsel!.
Joey (think): I can't win an attack...! I'll play this in *defense mode*..
Bonz: Go, Dragon Zombie--.
Bandit Keith: Hold it!.
Bonz: Huh?.
Bandit Keith: Why just *defeat* 'im when you can *humiliate* 'im the way Pegasus did me? Beef up your zombies and you can wipe 'im out in a few turns. Play the King of Ghosts!.
Bonz: I hear ya, boss. Pumpking, ri-i-ise from the gra-a-ave!.
Pumpking the King of Ghosts 1500/2000/L6/dark.
Joey: W-what *is* that thing...?!.
Bonz: It's the Pumpking-- the King of Ghosts!.
Joey: What does it do?.
Bonz: Oh, well Pumpking has a very *special* ability-- Ectoplasmic Fortification!.
(Pumpking extends a vine to each of the zombies, rooting its tendrils into their flesh.) .
Joey: Ecta-whosis, uh, forta-whatsis?!.
Bonz: Ectoplasm is the ghostly substance that gives my zombie monsters their power, and Pumpking, as the King of Ghosts, can pump up their ectoplasmic energy,  and their attack points, by ten percent *each and every turn*. .
Joey: Oh no...!.
Bonz: And as their attack power grows, they become *giant zombies*!!!.
Bonz: Dragon Zombie-- attack with Deadly Zombie Breath!!.
Kojikocy ///.
Bonz: That defense monster was *much* too weak. Why don't you give me something *stronger* to destroy? .
Joey: You wish! Armored Lizard, defense mode!.
Bonz: Ectoplasmic Fortification!! Power up my zombie army!.
Bonz: And attack!.
Armored Lizard ///.
Joey: Unh. Well so much for Armored Lizard. .
Bonz: Ohh, this is *so cool*!! Boss, you're givin' me great advice!.
Bandit Keith (think): Nah, just *good* advice, so far, Bonz. But you've got *one card* that'll *demolish* the dweeb! .
Joey: Man. I can barely *defend* myself. .
Bonz: Deadly Zombie Breath!!.
Glass Man ///.
Bonz: Huhahahahaha! I'm wiping them out, one by one!.
Joey: He's right-- I'm done-for...!.
Bonz: Deadly Zombie Breath!!.
Masaki the Legendary Swordsman ///.
Joey: Unh... (think) That dragon's bad breath is *killin'* me... I lose another warrior, and his zombies only get *stronger*! This is *really bad*..
Bonz: Come on! Throw another card for my monsters to devour! .
Joey (think): There's gotta be *some* way to beat 'im. *Yugi* would know....
Yugi: Joey!.
Tristan: Joey!.
Joey: Huh?!.
Joey: Yugi...! You're *really here*..
Bandit Keith: Nngggh. (to Syd and Zigor) Block 'em!.
Yugi: What kind of duel arena *is* this?.
Tristan: Are you *crazy*, why in the world did you accept a duel in a place like this?!.
Joey: Yeah, like I had a *choice*! *Those three creeps* there ganged up on me an' *forced* me into this crazy duel!.
Tristan: Whoa!.
All: Huh?.
Tristan (picking a fight): This duel's *over*..
Syd: That's not up to you, *chum*. .
Tristan: I say it *is*!.
Zigor: Ya wanna stop it, ya gotta get past *me*!.
Tristan: My pleasure! Aaaaahh...!.
Yugi: Tristan! .
Joey: Tristan! Are you--.
Bandit Keith: Hold it! .
Joey: Huh?.
Bandit Keith: Remember, if you leave the arena you forfeit the duel, and all your star chips belong to *me*!.
Joey: What?!.
Téa: The duel is illegal anyway!.
Bakura: Right, Téa!.
Bandit Keith: Wrong, Téa! When he threw down his star chips, he *accepted* the duel. Heheheh!.
Tristan: In *that* case, Joey....
Tristan: You're just gonna have to *beat* these punks. And if you're gonna need a little added motivation, try *this*! .
Joey: Unh...? Serenity!.
Tristan: That's right, Joey, your sister. You're dueling for *her*..
Joey: Thanks, man. .
Bandit Keith: So what's it gonna be? You gonna cut 'n' run, dweeb, or ya gonna part with your star chips the *hard way*? .
Joey: 'Ey! I've had it up the *here* with your smart remarks! Spill! (points) Who are you, anyway!!.
Bandit Keith: Don't you *know*? They call me Bandit Keith..
Yugi: *You're* Bandit Keith? .
Téa: I've heard that name somewhere before...!.
Yugi: Yeah, he's the *intercontinental champion*, the guy that Kaiba told us about. He's only lost *one Duel Monsters challenge*, and that one was to Pegasus himself. .
Téa and Bakura: Oh....
Joey: Huh... no wonder *skullface* there has outsmarted me at every turn..
Bandit Keith: Why is why you oughta just pack it up an' *go home*, dweeb. 'Cause I've given my little pal Bonz here the perfect strategy. .
Bonz: Heheheheh....
Bandit Keith: You couldn't beat him with every card in your *deck*..
Zigor: Nobody's gonna get inside Pegasus' castle except Bandit Keith an' us! .
Bonz: You've fought your last duel, Joey! You're about to join the *other* zombies in this *graveyard field*!.
Yugi: A *graveyard field*...?.
Bonz: Come on! Play your next card or *rest in peace*!.
Joey: Huh...? (think) Serenity...! (aloud) For *your sake*-- I've *gotta* win!.
Bonz: No-- all your hopes and all your dreams will die right here!.
Joey: Says you, geek! I'll keep my defenses up until I find a way to attack! .
Bandit Keith: Ya know, you shouldn't broadcast your strategy..
Joey: I what?.
Bonz: Huhuheheheheh....
Bandit Keith: Especially when it's a *losing* one. Bonz has a special card in his deck that'll render all your defenses *useless*!.
Joey: You gotta be *bluffin'*, he can't *possibly* do that with one card! .
Bonz: Oh, *yeah*...?.
Bonz: This trap card (sic) can, it's called "Stop Defense"! .
Joey: Ugh, no....
Téa and Bakura: Ohh....
Yugi: "Stop Defense" is big trouble, Joey!.
Bonz: From now on, any card you try to play in defense mode will *activate the trap*!! And you still can't stop me from raising the ectoplasmic power of my zombies!.
Bonz: So now, all that's left is to snuff the last monster you have standing! Deadly Zombie Breath!.
Tiger Axe ///.
Bandit Keith: Ahaha! End a' the road for you, dweeb! You got nowhere left to run now!.
Joey: I letcha down, sis....
Téa: Don't let him scare you, Joey!.
Bakura: Hang in there..
Tristan: Whatever he says, don't quit!.
Joey: Quit?! No way!.
Joey: I *can't* give up! Not while Serenity's countin' on me! (draw) Go... Red-Eyes Black Dragon!.
Red-Eyes B. Dragon 2400/2000//.
Bandit Keith: Red-Eyes...?!  Where'd this dork get a card *that* rare?!.
Joey: If all my defenses are blocked, then I'll just have to take to the offense! Red-Eyes, *take out* that overgrown pumpkin! .
Bonz: What do I do? His attack power is greater than mine! .
Joey: Inferno-o-o Fire Blast!.
Bakura: All right!.
Yugi: Nice move, Joey, now he can't raise his monsters' attack power any higher! And since Pumpking was already a ghost from the start, he can't use "The Call of the Haunted" to bring him back!.
Bandit Keith: Minor setback, Bonz. .
Bonz: Huh?.
Bandit Keith: Don't forget, you've still got *more* than enough attack power to polish him off for *good*..
Bonz: Yeah! Okay, boss. Go, Dragon Zombie! Blow Red-Eyes away!!.
Joey: My Red-Eyes, no--!!.
Bonz: Hoohoohaha! *Even Red-Eyes* was no match for me!!.
Joey: With that card wiped out... I'm all but done-for!.
Bonz: Red-Eyes Black Dragon, up in smoke!.
Joey: He- he annihilated... my strongest card...!.
Bandit Keith: Hahahahaha! It's all over for *you*, dweeb! .
Tristan: Don't give up...! .
Joey (think): I'm all outta moves. The only *monster card* that I've got left is *Battle Warrior*, and his attack powers are *way* too low! .
Bonz: Well? Are you going to play or surrender!.
Téa: Yugi, isn't there some way Joey can beat that little ghoul?.
Yugi: He's in a big jam, Téa. Attacking the zombie army doesn't do any good; and that trap card blocks all his defenses. Defense...! (think) That's it! (aloud) Joey! *There is a way*! You've got a magic card in your deck that can turn this whole thing around!!.
Joey: Uh?.
Bonz: Huh?.
Bandit Keith: Heh. You've *gotta be kidding*. You're Yugi, right? Well maybe you beat Kaiba, but the strategy I gave Bonz is just *perfect*. Your friend is a goner..
Yugi: Joey, he's wrong!.
Joey: You sure?.
Joey: Okay, yeah! (draw) Trust in the cards...!.
Joey: Yeah...! This is... the one! This must be the card Yugi was talkin' about. (think) "Shield and Sword" is a magic card  that swaps the attack and defense points of every monster on the field. If I could take away the zombies' attack power by flipping it to defense, his monsters won't be able to stop my next card! (aloud) Yup; it's my only chance! Battle Warrior! In attack mode!.
Battle Warrior 700/1000/L2/.
Bonz: So, it's the only move you have left, huh?.
Joey: And then I add, this magic card called "Shield and Sword"! .
Bandit Keith: What?!.
Joey: Go! Offensive-Defensive Flip!.
Bonz: Ohh...!.
Bandit Keith (think): Zombie monsters have no will of their own; they can't *defend themselves* on this turn! We're *sunk*!.
Bonz: My zombies' attack power has dropped to zero!!.
Joey: And my Battle Warrior's attack and defense points switch too, see?.
Joey: *Smash* those zombie freaks-- Ultimate Battle Fist!.
Bonz: Nygggghhh...!.
Bandit Keith (think): Ugh..! With their attack points at zero, the zombies can't come back to life! .
Bonz: How...could I... lose...?! .
Tristan: All right!!.
Téa: Joey, you won!.
Yugi: You did it, Joey!.
Joey: I did, didn't I!.
Yugi: Mm-hmm!.
Bandit Keith: See ya 'round, loser!.
Bonz: But, wait, boss--.
Joey: Mm?.
Syd: Wait up, boss!.
Zigor: Hey, boss!.
Joey: Bandit Keith!.
Bandit Keith: Hm?.
Joey: Maybe next time you'll have the nerve to duel me face-to-face instead a' hidin' behind your *creepy flunkies*! .
Bandit Keith: Heh. Duel you face-to-face? You're hopeless, dweeb; the game of Duel Monsters is all about keeping your opponents off-balance. Winning the duel's all that matters-- not how you go *about* it! .
Joey: We'll just see about that, Bandit Keith!.
Bandit Keith: Heheheh! Yeah, right-- I'm quivering in fear already, *dweeb*. Heheheheheh!.
Téa: What a *jerk*. .
Joey: Guys, look, I'm really sorry. I didn't mean to drag all a' ya into this mess. .
Tristan: *Next* time, don't be in such a big hurry to run off on your own! .
Yugi: Hey, it's all right. We know that it wasn't your fault, Joey. .
Tristan (winks): Yeah, I mean, as long as he won the *duel*--  we can forgive 'im..
Téa: I admit you had us worried at first..
Bakura: But you really came through this time. .
Joey: I got lucky, that's all..
Yugi: It *wasn't luck*, Joey. .
Joey: Huh?.
Yugi: It was your determination, your trust in the cards, and the promise you made to your sister. *That's* what helped you win..
Joey: I only need two more star chips; hang in there, Serenity! .
Téa: So now can we get *outta* this creepy pit? .
Joey: *Nothin's* gonna stop us now!.
Joey: Heyyy-- daylight!! .
Joey: Oh no, what's that!!.
Bandit Keith: Hehahahah! Tough luck, guys, looks like you're stuck in that cave for life! .
Bandit Keith: Now *we* gotta have a little *talk*. .
Bonz: Uh-- talk about *what*, boss?.
Bandit Keith: Your star chips!.
Syd: Zigor!.
Bandit Keith: Next? .
Bonz: Boss-- w-what's wrong? .
Bandit Keith: What's *wrong* is that *you lost*! .
Bonz: Uh, but boss, I did exactly what you *told* me! .
Bandit Keith: You lost!!! Now hand 'em over!.
Bonz: Owowowowowowow!.
Syd (wailing): Take 'em! Just take 'em! Ohh....
Bandit Keith: Ten star chips. Not exactly the way I'd planned to *get 'em*, but at least now I know I'll get into the castle..
Zigor (moans): I hate when 'e gets like this...!.
Bandit Keith: I'm coming, Pegasus. We got a *score to settle*..
Joey: Uggghhh... this thing ways a *ton*! I can't even get it to *budge*! .
Tristan: Push harder, come on!!.
Téa: Are we really *trapped in here*?!.
Joey: Eh, this thing ain't budgin', boys an' girls..
Joey: Looks like we're trapped..
Tristan: Come on, there's gotta be another way outta this place..
Téa: But these tunnels run everywhere; we could be lost down here forever!.
Tristan: *Forever*...?.
Téa: Huh...? Bakura?.
Joey: Hey. Bakura-- what gives?.
Bakura: It seems my Millennium Ring is tugging me in *this* direction. .
Joey: Huh?.
Téa: Why?.
Bakura: Well, Yugi and I think that my Millennium Ring can detect other Millennium Items....
Bakura (via screen): ...And that it's been honing in on Pegasus's Millennium Eye. .
Yugi (via screen): So it *could* be leading us right to his castle!.
Joey (via screen): *Pegasus*! I can't *wait* to get my hands on that creep! .
Pegasus: I *love* this show. But what's playing on *Dungeon T.V.*?.
Pegasus (VO): Oh, goodie. .
Pegasus (VO): It's another installment in the *sad little saga of Mokuba*, ahahahaha... .
Mokuba: (snif) My brother'll come for me. (snif) I *know* he'll come, like he always has..
FlashBack Seto: It's just you and me, now, kid. But it'll be okay..
Mokuba (VO): Like the way he came for me the day mom and dad passed away....
FlashBack Mokie: I... I'm scared, Seto..
FlashBack Seto: Don't worry. I'll always be there for you, Mokuba..
FlashBack Seto (VO): I *promise*..
Mokuba (think): Pegasus thinks that by keeping me locked away, he can take over your company, KaibaCorp. But Pegasus doesn't know you like *I* do..
Mokuba (VO) How, when we were growing up, you never lost at *anything*! You'd never give up. You'd just keep on goin' 'til you'd beaten *everyone*!.
Mokuba (think): And you're gonna beat Pegasus the same way! So come and rescue me, big brother....
FlashBack Seto (VO): Don't worry. I'll always be there for you, Mokuba. I *promise*. .
Mokuba: ...Come soon..
Joey: So, we *gettin' anywhere*, Bakura?.
Tristan: 'S like we've been walkin' *forever*..
Joey: Instead a' lookin' like the way out, it seems like a *big maze*. .
Téa: That's right. And look at the *walls* down here. All the rocks are neatly-arranged; it seems... man-made. .
Téa: You think someone could be *living* down here?.
Joey: They'd have to be *mole-people*..
Yugi: Look at all these corridors...!.
Yugi: There must be a *dozen different directions* we could go..
Tristan: So *now* what? Which way do we go?.
Bakura: ...*This* way. .
Téa: Huh?.
Bakura: Follow me! The Ring is pulling me this way!.
Joey: Well tell it to pull *slower*!.
Joey: Huh?!.
Yugi: Bakura! What is it? Why've you stopped?.
All: Whoa...!.
Téa: What *is* this place? .
Para: You have entered--.
Dox: Sacred ground..
Para: Where only duelists--.
Dox: Can be found..
Joey: Yeah, well we're duelists....
Para: Before you pass--.
Dox: Across this chamber....
Para: Hoh-hah!.
Dox: Huya!.
Para: Hiya!.
Dox: Hoyuhoyuhoya!.
Para: You must agree--.
Dox: To face the danger!.
Para: So let the contest--.
Dox: Now begin!.
Para: Notify--.
Dox: Your next of kin!.
Para: You're trapped--.
Dox: And the doors are all locked!.
Both: Ha! Hoo-wah! You face the Brothers-- Paradox!.
Para: Employed by Pegasus as eliminators--.
Dox: To take all your star chip indicators!.
Joey: You gotta *duel* these goons, Yugi?.
Para: And if, by some crazy fluke, you manage to win--.
Dox: Why then, a puzzling *new* test shall begin..
Para: For over my shoulder, you see a door! And over my brother's, you'll see....
Dox: One door more! .
Para: The test-- a choice!.
Dox: That you-- must make!.
Both: Which of these doors will you take! Huh!.
Joey: ...Huh?.
Para: One door leads to an endless maze....
Dox: Where you will wander, all your days. .
Para: The other door's the path you need..
Dox: Choose correctly, and be freed!.
Para: But which door leads out?.
Dox: And which leads to woe?.
Para: That's for *you to guess*--.
Dox: And for the Brothers Paradox to know!.
Téa: So even if Yugi wins this match, we could still wind up lost in those caves forever?.
Para: Against *us*, one mere duelist would be creamed!.
Dox: So you must duel, as a team..
Bakura: Two on two...?.
Joey: Like a tag-team...?.
Tristan: I never heard of *anyone* dueling like *that*. .
Paradox Brothers: Heheheheheh....
Yugi: Me neither-- but I don't think we have much of a choice here..
Yugi: Yu-Gi-Oh...!!.
Yugi (Yami): Tag-team it is-- and I'd be honored if Joey would duel by my side. .
Joey: Hm! *You got it*, bro. .
Joey: All right, youse Brothers Paradox--.
Joey: Me'n Yugi are gonna *clean your clocks*!.
Para: Prepare to be puzzled--.
Dox: Prepare to be fooled--.
Paradox Brothers: Prepare to be *baffled*, for on this field, we rule!.
Joey (aside): I'm gonna baffle the two a' *them* if they don't stop rhymin'....
Para: Heheheheheh; enough of your quips!.
Dox: Yes! Time to wager star chips!.
Joey: Rrrgghh. I'll throw down *two*. .
Yugi (Yami): Plus four more... for a total of *six*. .
Paradox Brothers: Agreed!.
Yugi (Yami): This is it, Joey; if we play our cards right, we'll both have enough star chips to gain entrance into the castle. Then we can finally confront Pegasus..
Joey: Right..
Para: Ha ha ha ha! You fool; that's why Pegasus pays my brother and me--.
Dox: To keep you from achieving victory!.
Téa: Okay guys, *teamwork* from here on out!.
Tristan: Right! We'll be the team, you do the work!.
Bakura: Good luck..
Paradox Brothers: Quiet, fools! Time to duel!.
Dox: First turn honors're mine!  Huh! Huh! Labyrinth Wall!.
Labyrinth Wall 0/3000/L5/earth.
Yugi (think): Huh? Why would he play *that* card? It doesn't even have any attack points..
Dox: Huhuhuhuhuh...!.
Téa: Ah...!.
Bakura: What's *that*?.
Tristan: Look, the floor-- somethin's comin' out of it..
Tristan: Strike *that*-- a whole *bunch* a' things are comin' out of it..
Yugi (Yami): A maze...!.
Dox: Quite right. And unless you can navigate it correctly, you'll be lost in its passageways forever..
Paradox Brothers: Now-- no more questions, no more stalls! Make your move, the labyrinth calls!.
Kaiba (think): Soon, Pegasus will be sorry, for the pain he's caused me and my brother..
Kaiba (think): Mokuba....
Kaiba (think): Doesn't he realize that nothing will stop me from getting him back?.
Kaiba (think): Well... he'll soon find out..
Para: Make your move. Go!.
Dox (overlapping): Now! Go! Now!.
Para (overlapping): Now! Go! Now!.
Joey: Hold your horses, already-- we don't even know how this *tag-team* thing *works*..
Para: Ah....
Dox: It's simple; we all start with two thousand lifepoints like *any* duel-- however-- if just one duelist loses those two thousand points, then his teammate loses with him. .
Joey (think): Man... Yugi's puttin' a lotta *faith* in me. I can't let 'im down!.
Para: The players on each team will alternate turns with every passing round. It is simple-- I will play; then Yugi; then my brother; then Joey; then back to me!.
Para: Now, as for the actual gameplay in the labyrinth arena, *it, too* is *quite simple*..
Para: All monsters you summon during this match will act like pieces on a game board. .
Para: As for moving, each monster can move the number of spaces equal to its power level..
Para: And while *your* monsters are moving, *ours* will be moving too! Finally-- if you somehow manage to get past our creatures, and find your way through the maze? Your reward will be a choice, of *two doors*. .
Yugi (Yami): Mmm....
Dox: Select the correct door, and find the path to freedom and fresh air!.
Para: Select the wrong door, and find only despair! .
Joey: Aaagghh! I've had *just about enough* of all your lame-brain rhymin'!! An' whaddaya mean, 'one door leads to despair', that's not *fair*! .
Paradox Brothers: Okay, then..
Para: We'll give you a clue-- while everything one of us tells you shall be true....
Dox: ...The other will speak nothing but lies to you!.
Téa: Ah...!.
Yugi (think): Truths and lies? What're they *talking* about?.
Pegasus: Ahahaha...! *Come now*, Yugi....
(He sips from his wineglass.) .
Pegasus: It's just a *riddle*. And you had better solve it; otherwise you won't see the light of day, or your grandpa, ever again!.
Para: From this point forward, one of us will speak nothing but the total truth--.
Dox: And the other will speak everything *but* the truth!.
Para: So you see, it is *quite simple*..
Dox: To learn which of the two is the right door--.
Para: You have *only to ask*--  nothing more! Haha--.
Yugi (Yami): (interrupts) Wait. .
Para: Hmm?.
Yugi (Yami): What if you're lying to me *right now*?.
Dox: No! I never lie!.
Yugi (Yami): Hmmmm....
Para: Don't be fooled; my door is most certainly the door that will guarantee you're freed!.
Dox: Liar! *Mine* is the door that'll grant safe passage; *if they'd only heed*!.
Joey (think): *Wa-a-ait a sec*... this sounds like an old riddle I know. Sure-- the liar, the truth-teller, the choosin' between two directions-- but how'd the rest of it go?.
Joey (VO): Hey Yugi, I think I know this riddle. It starts with a fork in the road; check this out-- there's this kid tryin' to get to the village a' truth-tellers..
Joey (VO): Thing is, there's a village a' *liars* right next to it. The kid doesn't know which way to go, so he asks a villager for directions..
Joey (VO): *But*, he doesn't know if the villager's from truth-ville, or *liars-burg*. So the villager guy says he'll answer *one question*-- and that's the riddle; what should the kid ask to get to truth-ville? .
Joey: So the kid asks the guy to take 'im to his *own* village! 'Cause a truthful guy would have to take 'im to the village a' truth on account a' bein' truthful....
(The villager turns and heads down the right-hand path, then backs up as Joey explains the alternate scenario.) .
Joey (VO): And a *liar* would have to take 'im to the village a' truth *too*, 'cause that'd be *lyin'*!.
Joey: So *first*-- we gotta find out which one a' you tells the truth!.
Dox: Then proceed!.
Para: In fact, we'll allow you each one question..
Joey: Okay-- like the kid in the riddle asked the guy to show 'im his village, all I have to do is ask you to show me your *door*! .
Joey: So *both a' ya*-- show me the door that you're guardin'!.
Joey (think): Huh! Now the *truthful* guy'll have to point to his *own* door, and the liar will have to point to the *other guy's* door!.
Joey: Bingo! Heeheeheehee....
Joey: Heheh! Worked like a charm! Para's the liar and Dox tells the truth! Now Yugi just has to ask Dox which door leads outta here, and we're set!.
Yugi (think): Hmm... I don't know; that seemed a little *too* easy!.
Joey: Yo, Yuge? How'bout a little somethin' for the effort here?.
Yugi (Yami): I hate to disappoint you, Joey,  but I don't think we've solved this riddle *just yet*. In fact... I think we're going down the *wrong road ourselves*, so to speak. .
Joey: But I *told* ya, Yuge, I *heard* this one before..
Yugi (Yami): Your riddle has *some* things in common with our present predicament, but there are some *key differences*. And trust me, Joey, those key differences change the entire nature of the problem. .
Joey: Huh?.
Yugi (Yami, VO): In your riddle, there was only one person to question at the crossroads. But in our situation, we have *two*-- Para *and Dox*..
Yugi (Yami, VO): Now, both Para and Dox have told us the *exact same thing*-- one of them will speak nothing but the truth, and the other will speak nothing but lies. .
Yugi (Yami): But there's a problem with that already..
Yugi (Yami, VO): Because if they *were*-- *as they said*-- one truth-teller and one liar, the liar could never admit to it. .
Yugi (Yami): *That would be telling the truth*. The only way they could both make that statement is....
Yugi (Yami, VO): If they were *both lying*. And that means we can't trust *either* Para, Dox, *or* their riddle..
Joey: Wow. My brain hurts. .
Yugi (Yami): Don't worry about it, Joey; that riddle was just meant to throw us off-course. Let's *duel* now and figure out the *door dilemma* later..
Joey: Nice call, Yuge. I do all my best problem-solvin' on the field anyways..
Yugi (Yami): Now let's *win* this duel. (think) I'll have to be careful; I've never played on a *labyrinth* field before..
Yugi (Yami): I'll go first-- with my Beaver Warrior!.
Beaver Warrior 1200/1500/L4/earth.
Para: A good choice; a rat for a maze!.
Dox: But his time's running out, this is the last of his days!.
Yugi (Yami): We'll see about that. Beaver, forward four spaces; one for each of your level points..
Para: Heh!.
Dox: Hahahaha! Four spaces and you're *already* in too far!.
Para: Now it's *my* turn. And I am merging Shadow Ghoul into the Labyrinth Wall itself, by means of "Polymerization"..
Shadow Ghoul 1600/1300/L5/dark.
(Yugi gasps; a shadowy shape flits over the surface of the maze walls.) .
Yugi (Yami): What the...?!.
Para: Wall Shadow... Reaping Claw Slash!! .
Para: Good-bye, Beaver Warrior! Hah...!.
Téa: Ah...! It came outta the wall!.
Téa (VO): And now it's going back, where our guys can't get at it! .
Yugi (Yami): Hmm..
Yugi (Yami): Very lethal..
Joey: They're *cheatin'*! It moved too many spaces!!.
Para: On the contrary. The Wall Shadow didn't move *any* spaces, it moved on the *wall*. .
Dox: That's right-- and the wall doesn't *have* any spaces!.
Joey: Rrrgghh....
Yugi (think): This is *not good*! *Our* monsters have to count spaces as they walk the maze, while their Wall Shadow can move *through* the maze walls. And that means-- he can strike when we least expect it!.
Para: So now you know our strategy, is unleashing a monster that you cannot see..
Dox: You fools! You won't know, when the Wall Shadow's about to land a blow! .
Yugi (Yami): Huh!.
Joey: We'll see about that; Axe Raider, in attack mode! Hmm, and I'll also place one *other* card facedown on the field..
Axe Raider 1700/1150/L4/earth.
Joey: But since I can't *see* your shifty little monster, I can't attack it; so I won't advance at all this turn. I'll just keep Axe Raider as far away from the wall *and* your sneaky weasel as possible-- and I'll *still* be ready to attack at any moment. (to Yugi) Right?.
Yugi (Yami): Right, that's a good move, Joey! As long as you keep far away from the wall, you can avoid any sneak attack by the Wall Shadow. .
Joey (think): So far, so good; I haven't cost us any lifepoints....
Téa: Good move. I hope Joey can keep this up. .
Bakura: Don't sweat it, with Yugi as his partner Joey can't lose!.
Tristan: I hope you're right..
Téa and Bakura: Huh?.
Tristan: This tag-team stuff is tricky, 'cause they can focus on attacking the weakest duelist first..
Téa: You mean Joey..
Dox: My turn! And I lay this card facedown. Jirai Gumo!.
Jirai Gumo 2100/100/L4/earth .
Dox: Hmhmhmhm! (think) Any opposing monster that steps on the space with Jirai Gumo's symbol, will instantly fall victim to its fatal surprise! Hmhmhahahah! (aloud) I'll also lay the Labyrinth Tank, in attack mode-- and move it forward seven spaces!.
Labyrinth Tank 2400/2400/L7/.
Dox: Hm hm hm hm hm hm!.
Para: Good job, brother. That should help trap them within our maze!.
Dox: Thank you, brother!.
Yugi (Yami): It's my turn..
Yugi (Yami): I play the Celtic Guardian in attack mode. Advance four paces, into the maze..
Bakura: But the Celtic Guardian's attack strength is *much* lower than that of Wall Shadow's..
Téa: Then he'll be wiped out..
Para: Yaaah!.
Dox: Huyah!.
Paradox Brothers: Hayayayayayayayah-- huh!.
Para: Ta! You fool! Did you not learn *anything*? Wall Shadow, attack Celtic Guardian now!.
Dox: Your Guardian is doomed,  and your lifepoints with it!.
Yugi (Yami): Hm! I'm afraid *not*..
Para: What do you mean?!.
Joey: "Kunai With Chain"!.
Para: What is this?!.
Joey: My trap card worked! Reel 'im in, Axe Raider!.
Joey: Heheh! The card I played facedown before was a trap card, Kunai With Chain. It captures any opponent that attacks! I laid that trap card to help Yugi; it raised the Celtic Guardian's attack power by five hundred, putting its strength *higher* than Wall Shadow's! .
Yugi (Yami): Celtic Guardian, attack Wall Shadow!.
Joey: So now it's *lights-out* for your shadow!.
Para: N-no!.
Joey and Yugi (Yami): Wall Shadow is beaten! .
Téa: What a team!.
Bakura: Yeah, they're working *together* to beat those wacky brothers!.
Tristan (think): Joey's really gettin' to be a *much* better player. He's thinking strategically..
Para: Aah! To stop our decline, these two we must halt! .
Dox: Don't look at me, it's not *my* fault!.
Joey: Hah! If we keep this up, we'll win this double duel and have enough star chips to enter the castle! *Teamwork*, Yugi!.
Yugi (Yami): Right! But we haven't won *yet*..
Yugi (Yami): We've got to keep on our guard, if we're going to beat the Paradox Brothers and win our way out of....
Yugi (Yami, via screen): ...This twisted underground labyrinth..
Pegasus: A toast to Yugi-- for winning the first round; *with the help* of his little pal, Joey. .
Pegasus: Hmph!.
Croquet: Master Pegasus. A thousand pardons for interrupting, your greatness..
Pegasus: I'm growing tired of your constant interruptions, Croquet. .
Croquet: I- I thought you'd want to know- Seto Kaiba's been spotted on the island..
Pegasus: I already *know* that, Croquet. Why are *you*, the head of my security, always the last to learn these things? Don't worry; Kaiba will come to us. After all....
Pegasus: We have the *bait*..
Pegasus (VO): Ahahahahaha, ha....
Mokuba (think): Ah... What's happened to you, brother?  Why haven't you come? You said you'd *always be here for me*. Well, where *are* you? You never failed me *before*....
FlashBack Mokie: Give it back! Give it to me!.
- I give! I give!.
FlashBack Young Seto: Here, Mokuba..
FlashBack Mokie: Thanks....
Mokuba (think): You *always* come through for me... So where are you *now*, Seto? Why haven't you found me? I *need* you; why haven't you stopped Pegasus?.
Kaiba (think): I'm coming, Mokuba. I'm coming to save you-- and if Pegasus tries to get in my way, he'll *live* to regret it!.
Kaiba (think): I'm almost to Pegasus's castle; I gotta be on my guard..
Kaiba (think): His goons are everywhere; but they won't stop me.  *Nothing* will..
Kaiba (think): Mokuba's *life's* at stake! And nothing's more important than my little brother..
Kaiba (think, VO): After our parents died, I promised I'd always take care of him; and I will. .
Kaiba (think, VO): He's always looked up to me; and I won't disappoint 'im..
Kaiba (think): Not now, not *ever*..
Kemo: So, it's the famous Sedo Kaiba..
Kemo: Searching for your little brother, no doubt!.
Kemo: Heh heh heh heh! You're comin' with me! Aaa-aa-aah!.
Kaiba: *Actually*-- you're coming with *me*..
Kaiba: *You're* gonna help me find Mokuba, wherever Pegasus has 'im..
Kaiba: And you're gonna start by getting me into *that castle*..
Para: With that trap, you stopped our attack--.
Dox: Just as you did pledge. But with our scores--.
Para: Ahead of yours, we still have the edge!.
(Dox has 2000 lifepoints, Para 1700, Yugi 1600, and Joey 2000.) .
Joey: Hmmmph....
Joey: We're just gettin' *started*!.
Joey (think): Hm. So far the only monster I got on the field is my Axe Raider. I need to bolster our attack force..
Joey: Now-- my Flame Swordsman will heat things up! I put it in attack mode..
Flame Swordsman 1800/1600/L5/.
Joey: Its power level is five, but I'll move only four spaces..
Joey: I'll also move Axe Raider forward four spaces to join 'im and consolidate our forces. I've a'ready used up Kunai With Chain's trap effect, but it still works as a regular accessory card, raising Axe Raider's attack power by five hundred points!.
Joey: Let's see ya take *that* on, ya twisted twins!.
Para: It doesn't matter if your forces are one or many, for soon--.
Dox: There won't be *any*! Labyrinth Tank, advance seven more spaces!.
Dox: Labyrinth Tank wields futuristic weaponry;  your archaic soldiers don't stand a chance! And soon they will be within striking range!.
Para: And somewhere in the labyrinth lurks another trap for your unwary warriors. (Jirai Gumo) Do you really think you stand a chance?.
Joey: Don't you two *ever* stop yakkin'? You're up, Yugi..
Yugi (Yami): Then I play-- Dark Magician, in attack mode!.
Dark Magician 2500/2100/L7/dark.
Yugi (Yami): I move him forward five spaces, to defend our other warriors..
Joey: *Cool*! Nice move, Yugi-- now the gang's all here. They're a team-- just like you an' me, pal..
Yugi (Yami): Right, Joey; there's strength in numbers. Together they stand a much better chance of conquering this *murderous maze*..
Dox: Rrrgghhh....
Para: We shall see about that..
Joey: Quit grinnin' and spit it out! What is it?.
Para: It's a magic card. And that's cause for celebration, *brother*..
Dox: Right!.
Para: Yah!.
Dox: Hyah!.
Para and Dox: Oyoyoyoyoyo!.
Dox: Ah!.
Para: Hyah!  Now, face the wall-warping power of-- "Magical Labyrinth"! .
Yugi (Yami): ...Huh?.
Joey: What's goin' on?.
Téa: The maze-- it's changing!.
Téa: And that changes the *whole game*!.
Yugi (Yami): Oh, no! The maze is changing shape!.
Joey: Yeah-- but what's it all mean?.
Joey: That's just *great*! Our guys're cut off from each other!.
Para (think): Hahaha, that's the power of the Magical Labyrinth, to reshape the maze according to our will. That should rattle them!.
Dox: Tag teams are only as strong as their weakest link-- (to Joey) and the link that's about to break is *you*!.
Joey: Oh, no, our strategy's blown!.
Yugi (Yami): Don't let them rattle you, Joey..
Joey: Eh?.
Joey: Right, Yuge. Huh; gotta keep calm..
Joey: Axe Raider, Flame Swordsman, advance and regroup. .
Joey: The closer our boys get to the maze exit, the closer *we* get to gettin' *outta* here!.
Para and Dox: Heheheheheheheh....
Yugi (Yami): Wait--! Joey, look out!!.
Dox: Too late! He activated my trap!.
Jirai Gumo 2200///.
Joey: Whaaa?!.
Dox: And now, the land mine spider attacks Axe Raider!.
Joey: Fend 'im *off*, Axe Raider!.
Dox: He's too weak! Jirai Gumo reduces Axe Raider's attack power to its original seventeen hundred..
Joey: Hnh? That means--!.
Dox: Your Axe Raider is vanquished!.
Para: And you lose four hundred lifepoints!.
Para and Dox: Hmhmhmhmhmhmhm....
Téa: Four hundred points?!.
Tristan: You're right; Joey just walked right *into* that one!.
Para: Good trap, my brother..
Dox: Mmm. That's just the beginning! Labyrinth Tank, advance seven more!.
Dox: And then I'll lay one more card, in defense mode!.
Joey: Aren'tcha gonna tell us what it is?.
Dox: Hmhmhmhmhmhmhmhmhm.  You have enough to worry about; my Labyrinth Tank is now within striking distance of your Flame Swordsman. It's *all over* for him in the next turn. Then you can worry about what *other* surprises I have in store..
Dox: Heheheheheheheheh....
Joey: Rrrrgghhh....
Bakura: This doesn't look good..
Tristan: *Tell* me about it. It's a good thing Yugi's up next..
Yugi (Yami): We'll counterattack. I play the magic card "Mystic Box", in combination with the Dark Magician..
Para and Dox: Aiii--!.
Yugi (Yami): I seal my Dark Magician within the first mystic box, as swords rain from the sky!!.
Dox: Hmm, what's this? The duelist's gone mad, sacrificing his own monster!.
Para: No wait-- look..
Dox: Ah! Another box, materializing around my Jirai Gumo?.
Para and Dox: Wah!!.
(Inside is Jirai Gumo's card, pierced by the swords.) .
Dox: My spider is skewered!.
Dox: And his Dark Magician is--.
Para and Dox: Unharmed?!.
Yugi (Yami): Right. My Dark Magician magically switched his position with that of your monster, trapping him in the first mystic box, and ending my *magic act.*.
Joey: All ri-i-i-ight..! Let's see cue ball top that!.
Yugi (Yami, nods): Hm! And now for his tank. Dark Magician-- Dark Magic Attack!.
Yugi (Yami): Let's see what *that* does to your lifepoints!.
Dox: Ahhhhh!.
Yugi: Together, Joey and I will overcome any obstacles that you two put in our way!.
Kaiba: You have security clearance. Open it!.
Kemo: Don'tcha think we should ring the bell?.
Kaiba: *I* think you should shut your mouth and open the door. *Open it now*..
Kemo: Hmhm. You *do know* no one takes Pegasus by surprise. .
Kemo (VO): He probably already knows you're here... *somehow*..
Mokuba (think): Big brother....
Mokuba (think): ...Where *are* you?.
Joey: Okay, dumbo duo-- now we're gonna clean your clocks..
Dox: Of yourself, you think too much; show them, brother, our lucky touch!.
Para: Hmhmhmhm!.
Joey: Huh?.
Yugi (Yami): Mm?.
Joey: I don't like it when that goon grins....
Para (think): Sanga of Thunder is one of three gods that control thunder, wind, and water. The remaining two cards are Suijin, god of water, and Kazejin, god of wind. If our luck holds two more turns, and we acquire them all, they can be combined to create the Gate Guardian!.
Joey: Quit your mumblin', no-hair! Just hurry up an' move!.
Para: Not so hasty; I will lay this card facedown, ending my turn. .
Dox: Intriguing, eh?.
Yugi (Yami): What could be in there?.
Joey: Huh. I dunno-- but we'll *bust it open* and find out when our guys get there..
Joey: Flame Swordsman-- advance five more spaces toward the end a' the maze!.
Joey: We're *almost there*, Yugi!.
Dox (think): I can't let them escape the maze until we've assembled all the pieces of the Guardian! (aloud) Now we'll test *my* luck..
Dox (think): Suijin, the water god! (aloud) Looks like I've *doubled our delights*..
Para and Dox: Hmhmhmhmhmhmhm!.
Téa: Another... Chinese box..
Bakura: What could they be?.
Yugi (Yami): Ugh... I've got a bad feeling about those boxes. I sense something ancient... and evil. .
Yugi (Yami): It's like I can feel a powerful, *dangerous* energy, pulsating inside them..
Dox (think): We cannot summon the gatekeeper yet, but we *can* still slow our enemies' advance!  (aloud) I now play my hidden card. Dungeon Worm, return to the surface now, in attack mode!.
Dungeon Worm 1800/1500//.
Dox: And I will strengthen him with "Invigoration", which raises its attack power by four hundred points!.
Yugi (Yami): What is *that* beast?! ...Huh?.
Dox: It's a *burrower*, and it's coming for you!.
Joey: Where'd it go? Where's that thing hidin'? ... Ahh!.
Yugi (Yami): No!.
Joey: No! My Celtic Guardian! Dox: Watch your lifepoints go *slithering away*!.
Para and Dox: Hmhmhmhmhm!.
Tristan: Hey, that's not fair! That creature could pop up *anyplace*!.
Téa: That's true-- this field gives their monsters *all the advantage*!.
Para: That's right!.
Dox: No one escapes the labyrinth!.
Joey: 'Sup to you, Yuge; you're gonna have ta' pull a winner outta your hat..
Yugi (Yami): Great idea! I play "Magical Hats"! Hats, materialize! As for our warriors--  now you see them....
Yugi (Yami): ... Now you don't..
Para: Ah! The hats!.
Dox: They're multiplying, hiding all their monsters!.
Joey: A'right, Yuge, that should sure confuse that *slimy worm* a' theirs!.
Yugi (Yami): And the Dungeon Worm's attack power is only twenty-two hundred, while the Dark Magician's is twenty-*five* hundred. So if the Worm chooses the wrong hat and uncovers the Dark Magician, he'll *only destroy himself*..
Para and Dox: Rrrgghh!.
Yugi (Yami): And that guarantees your Swordsman's safety as well, because with the Dark Magician lying in wait the Worm dare not strike *any* hats..
Para: Ha! Your little plan is not as foolproof as you *think*, Yugi. Monster Tamer, appear now in attack mode!.
Monster Tamer 1800/1600/L5/earth.
Monster Tamer: Hyah!.
Yugi (Yami): Hmm? The *Monster Tamer*?.
Para: Ha! Normally I couldn't control the Dungeon Worm or any other monster my brother placed on the field; but by using this Monster Tamer--.
Monster Tamer: Ha!.
Para: I can add six hundred points to the Dungeon Worm's attack power, and also make the Worm follow my Tamer's instructions during my turn!.
Yugi (think): Ohh, *twenty-eight hundred*! That raises the Dungeon Worm's attack power higher than the Dark Magician's..
Para: Now, Monster Tamer! Command my brother's Dungeon Worm to destroy one of the magic hats!.
Yugi (think): With their Dungeon Worm powered up by the Monster Tamer, this all comes down to luck..
Para: Hm! Empty hat!.
Joey: Whoa-- *that* was close..
Yugi (think): Huh, luck was with us this time, but the Dungeon Worm will attack again next turn, and then, with only one empty hat remaining, the odds will be against us. *What can we do*?.
Joey: Don't sweat it!.
Yugi (Yami): Huh?.
Joey: I got it all figured out, you jus' sit back an' watch me an' the Flame Swordsman go!.
Yugi (Yami): Joey, what're you doing?.
Tristan: Is Joey *nuts*? His Swordsman was safe!.
Joey: Don' worry, this time I know what I'm doin'. I play the magic card "Salamandra"! .
Para and Dox: Ahh!.
Joey: That's right-- you oughta be scared. It juices up any fire-based blade an' raises its attack points seven hundred..
Joey: Swordsman! Salamandra Flame Strike!.
Para: Where is it going?!.
Bakura: Good show! Not *only* does Salamandra increase the Swordsman's attack strength, but because of the Worm's weakness to *fire*, it negates the bonus points the Worm got from the Monster Tamer, returning its attack power to twenty-two-hundred!.
Joey: Less than my supercharged Swordsman! *The worm turns*-- or should I say, *burns*?.
Joey: Top that!.
Yugi (Yami): Joey, great move! Good going!.
Téa and Tristan: You did it!.
Para (to Dox): You must draw the card we need!.
Dox: Indeed! Hmmm....
Dox: Ha! The third piece! This will seal their fate!.
Para: Hmm, the third piece--.
Dox: Ha!.
Para: With which we'll now create--.
Dox: A monster who will--.
Para and Dox: Annihilate!.
Para: Ha!.
Dox: Ha!.
Para: Against--.
Dox: The Trinity--.
Para: They can't defend!.
Dox: All their lifepoints, we will rend! .
Kazejin 2400/2000/L7/wind.
Para and Dox: Summon Kazejin, god of wind!.
Joey: Ah..! Yugi, what's happenin'?.
Yugi (Yami): Oh no-- the Trinity!.
Yugi (Yami): It's in the class of Exodia!.
Joey: Whoa!.
Para and Dox: Elements of thunder, water, and wind, / Suijin, Sanga, Kazejin begin, / Meld your powers in eternal light, / Show these fools your unstoppable might!.
Yugi (Yami): Here it comes!!.
Tristan: What *is* it?.
Téa: I dunno..
Para: He is pain beyond description!.
Dox: He'll mark the graves with your inscription!.
Para and Dox: Gate Guardian!.
Para and Dox: Against our Gate Guardian, you cannot possibly win!.
Suijin 2500/2400//.
Kazejin 2400/2200//.
Sanga 2600/2200//.
Yugi (Yami): Ah! It has the strength of *three monsters*! .
Joey: Yeah, he's three guys in *one*! We're *never* gettin' outta this maze....
Téa: *Now* what do they do?.
Bakura: I don't know; this looks bad..
Tristan: Don't be so downbeat, Bakura; if they don't beat 'im, we'll *never* get outta the labyrinth..
Bakura: Tristan, thanks for *cheerin' me up*, mate..
Joey: So! Think you can beat us with your big multiple guy? Well we're not givin' up! Let's go-- bring it on!.
Para: Ha ha ha ha ha! You must be mad!.
Dox: No one's *ever* gotten past the Gate Guardian..
Para: He is composed of three parts, each controlling an elemental force..
Dox: You'll never get past his combined power!.
Para: You will wander the labyrinth--.
Para and Dox: Lost for all eternity..
Joey: Me 'n' Yugi'll take on anything that you got!.
Yugi (Yami): Joey's right; we're a team! You'll *never* beat our combined power. Take your turn!.
Para and Dox: Ha!.
Kaiba: I told you to take me to Mokuba-- not on a tour. 'S endless....
Kemo: These tunnels're honeycombed throughout the entire island. Without me to guide you, you could get lost down here for *years*!.
Kaiba: *Don't* get any ideas. .
Kemo: Listen, slim, I'm much bigger and much stronger than you are. You only got the jump on me, 'cause ya snuck up and took me by surprise! What's to stop me from spinnin' around *right now*  and knockin' your--.
Kaiba: Try it and I'll drop you where you stand!!.
Kemo: Well, when you put it *that* way-- nothing would please me more than to reunite you with your brother Mokuba!.
Kaiba: Rrgghh....
Mokuba (think): You *promised*, Seto. You promised you'd never let anyone separate us!.
Mokuba (think, VO): ...Even at the orphanage... when all the other boys were being adopted one by one... some parents wanted *you*-- said you were a genius! But you refused to go... without me..
FlashBack Mokie: Thank you! That could've been you!.
Mokuba (think, VO): But you said we weren't leaving the orphanage until we could both leave *together*..
FlashBack Mokie: You won't let them separate us?.
FlashBack Seto: *Never*. Don't you worry; no one will *ever* keep us apart..
Mokuba (think): But what about Pegasus? You couldn't stop him from capturing me....
Mokuba (think): Is he too much for you to handle...? (closes locket) What if he's got *you*, too?.
Kemo: Okay; this is as far as we go..
Kaiba: Where's Mokuba? .
Kemo: In Pegasus's grip, just like you'll soon be, Kaiba..
Kaiba: Stop playing games!.
Kaiba: Ah! The alarm!.
Kemo: If you wanna find your brother before reinforcements arrive, better hurry! Security will be here *any moment*..
Kaiba: Mokuba! I've gotta get 'im outta here-- away from Pegasus!.
Croquet: Sir, Kemo has reported in. It seems Seto Kaiba has been spotted in the tunnels..
Pegasus: Hm, once again, Croquet-- you report what I already know..
Croquet: I- beg your pardon, master..
Pegasus (stands): You can beg later, when you are punished..
Croquet: Huh?.
Pegasus: Seto Kaiba's presence on the island was not part of my original plan; but perhaps I can turn this to my advantage... *and* my amusement!.
Kaiba: Mokuba!!.
Kaiba: Mokuba!.
Mokuba: Seto! My brother's here!.
Téa: It's your turn, Yugi!!.
Tristan: *Attack* that big ugly lug!.
Yugi (Yami): Nothing in my deck is powerful enough to attack the Gate Guardian.  I can only play *these*..
Para: What a waste of a turn. You're frightened, for all your monsters are too weak to attack ours! Gate Guardian, use your immense power; attack Flame Swordsman, eliminate him from the field!.
Joey: This is it, bud, we're goin' down in a big way!.
Yugi (Yami): Rrgh!.
Para: Thunderstroke Attack!!.
Joey: Flame Swordsman is about to *flame out*!.
Joey: This is one lightnin' storm I don't think my Swordsman's gonna weather! (to Yugi) If ya got any bright ideas, now's the time..
Para: Gate Guardian, Thunderstroke Atta-a-a-a-a-ck!.
Joey: Ahh! Can't look!.
(The attack hits Flame Swordsman.) .
Para: Ha! Now you see, our Gate Guardian conquers all!.
Yugi (Yami): Rrrgh, not *this* turn!.
Para: Huh?!.
Yugi (Yami): Unless he's not affected by traps! "Mirror Force", reflect his attack!.
Joey: All *right*!!.
Para: Gate Guardian, defend! Squall Barricade!.
Para and Dox: Ha ha ha ha ha....
Para: Our monster's not felled!.
Dox: You've been repelled!.
Yugi (Yami): Hmhmhm! Yes, but your Guardian has deflected my attack right at your Monster Tamer!.
Para and Dox: Uah!!.
Yugi (Yami): You've destroyed your own monster..
Para and Dox: Uah!.
Dox: Lucky move!.
Yugi (Yami): Hm!.
Téa: Way to play, fellas. Keep it up and we'll be outta these *musty old caves* in no time!.
Joey: You got it, Téa!.
- Give it up, Kaiba! We know you're in here somewhere! .
- Yeah, it's no use hidin'!.
- Sir, maybe he's gone-- I can't find any *trace* of 'im!.
- Impossible, there's no *way* he could've escaped!.
- But sir, I've checked *every corridor*!.
- Then stand guard by his brother's cell; he'll show up. Now *go*!.
- (both) Yes, sir!.
- Right away!.
Joey: All right-- now it's my turn!.
Yugi (Yami): Wait a minute, Joey! *Don't make your move just yet*..
Joey: Ah?.
Yugi (Yami): Look at the Gate Guardian. It was created by combining *three different monsters*, right?.
Joey: So?.
Yugi (Yami): *So*, that may be our ticket to dismantling him!.
Joey: Ri-ight! Section by section! Okay, then-- Flame Swordsman, use Salamandra's magic an' attack the midsection!.
Joey: Attaboy! Scorch 'im good!.
Yugi (Yami): Ah? .
Dox: You fool! Attack one section and the others will defend it! You wasted your turn! Now my Guardian will lay waste to you! Tidal Surge Attack!.
Joey: Uaugh...!.
Bakura: Oh, my..
Tristan and Téa: Huh?.
Bakura: Dox is using the water elemental section of his Gate Guardian to flush out the entire *maze*! Everything in its path will be attacked. The mystic properties of the magic hats will protect the Magician....
Bakura (VO): ... But I'm afraid Joey's Swordsman won't be as lucky..
Para: Ha!.
Dox: Ha!.
Para and Dox: Hoioioioioioioioioi--.
Para: Dah!.
Dox: Ha! We have taken the lead!.
Joey: For *now*..
Para and Dox: Heheheheh....
Yugi (Yami): Your Gate Guardian may've dampened the field, but not our spirits! For my turn I lay this card facedown, and, I call upon the Summoned Skull to finish the job Joey's Flame Swordsman started..
Summoned Skull 2500/1200//.
Para: Ohh, you must be *joking*! .
Dox: That swordsman started nothing before he left choking!.
Para and Dox: Haha!.
Yugi (Yami): Hmph, that's not *quite true*. If it weren't for him, the stage wouldn't be set for my Summoned Skull's attack!.
Para and Dox: Ouahh!.
Tristan: The *water*!.
Tristan (VO): Yugi's gonna use it as a conductor for an *electrical* attack!.
Yugi (Yami): Summoned Skull! Lightning Strike!.
Téa (VO): The water's actually *guiding* the attack!.
Joey: Payback time!.
Dox: Not yet! You may have found a watery trail leading back to our Guardian, but you have yet to breach his defenses! Defenses that *we activate now*!.
Para: Ah?.
Dox: Uh, what's wrong?.
Yugi (Yami): *What's wrong* is that by flooding the whole field with your Tidal Surge, you attacked my Magical Hats..
Yugi (Yami): And hidden underneath one of them, was a trap..
Dox: What?!.
Yugi (Yami): A trap that immobilizes your Guardian and leaves him powerless to defend himself. .
Dox: No!! My Gate Guardian!.
Yugi (Yami): Ensnared by my "Spellbinding Circle", and seven hundred defense points weaker because of it! .
Yugi (Yami): Leaving Suijin, your guardian's water elemental, *quite vulnerable* to my electrical attack!.
Yugi (Yami): One section down, two to go!.
Joey: Way to go, Yuge!.
Joey: We'll have this ugly lug chopped down to size in *no time*!.
Téa: That's the way to do it! Yeah!.
Tristan: Yeah! Go!.
Joey: Hey look, all the water's disappearing. Heheheh-- not only is Suijin *gone* but it looks like he took all of his water *with* 'im..
Para: Hmm. Our Guardian is only damaged, not beaten. "Remove Trap"..
Para: Ha! Even *without* Suijin, our Guardian is still unbeatable..
Joey: We'll see about that. Hnn...
Yugi (think): Their Gate Guardian may be unbeatable by any *monster*, but not by our teamwork..
Joey: All right, bozo brothers-- try this on for size, the Red-Eyes Black Dragon!.
Red-Eyes Black Dragon 2400/2000//.
(Summoned Skull growls a welcome as Red-Eyes lands on the field.) .
Yugi (Yami): And now, with the magic of my "Polymerization" card, I'll combine Joey's Red-Eyes with my Summoned Skull..
Para and Dox: Huh! Our combo!.
Yugi (Yami): You *now* face....
Joey: The supreme Black Skull Dragon!.
Black Skull Dragon 3200/2500//.
Joey: Your guy ain't so unbeatable *now*, huh?.
Yugi (Yami): Mm. Right! Let's see your labyrinth stop *him*..
Para: Hahahahaha!.
Para and Dox: Hahahahahahahahaha!.
Joey: What're you two clowns laughin' about?!.
Dox: You fools! You think your new creature will win the match for you?.
Para: You're wrong; there's little that your creature can do. For there is a maze rule that you must not have known....
Joey: A rule?! Oh no!!.
Dox: Oh, *yes*! And the rule states that the labyrinth is a *no flying zone*!.
Joey: Huh? Ah, nuts! An' my Red-Eyes Black Dragon can only move by *flight*.  These rules *stink*!.
Yugi (Yami): Don't worry. I have an alternate plan..
Joey: (sigh of relief) I was *hopin'* you'd say that. (to Para and Dox) Ya hear that?! We got a *backup plan*!.
Para and Dox: Hahahahahahahahaha!.
Joey: Uh, Yugi? Why don't they look worried?.
Joey: So uh, whaddaya think the *bald* brothers are up to, Yugi?.
Dox: You mock *us*? (draw) Huh. Hahahaha. But with this next card, I will trash your team! Huahaha!.
Para: Ha!.
Dox: Ha!.
Dox: "Riryoku"!.
Yugi (Yami): Uh! *Riryoku*?!.
Joey (to Yugi): 'S all Greek to *me* pal..
Yugi (Yami): Riryoku... it's a rare and mighty card, Joey..
Joey: Uhh!.
Dox: Too true! Riryoku's legendary power allows me to take half of my opponents' lifepoints and add them to one of my own creatures' attack points!.
Joey: No fair! You might as well be *stealin'*!.
Yugi (Yami): Stay strong!.
Dox: 'Stay strong'? .
Para: The only one on *this* field who will be staying strong is our Gate Guardian-- for he is the one we are powering up with your lifepoints!.
Téa: Ohh....
Tristan: That's like cutting their chances to win in half!.
Dox: Luckily for *you*, using the Riryoku card ends our turn; but when our next move is at hand, we will use our Gate Guardian's newfound power to win this duel once and for all! Haha!.
Para: He will turn your monsters into *smears* on the labyrinth wall!.
Joey: Ugh!.
Yugi (Yami): *Don't worry* about them, Joey, I still have a plan. First, I draw..
Yugi (Yami): Next step, my Dark Magician will leave the safety of the Magical Hats and return to the maze..
Yugi (Yami): Then he'll move six spaces forward-- and out of your labyrinth!.
Para: You fool! Why are you moving your Dark Magician out of the maze when you know our Gate Guardian is right there just waiting to attack?!.
Yugi (Yami): Does it *matter*? You seem certain he'll *win* regardless of what *I* do. .
Joey: Uh, yo Yuge. Not for nothin' , but, you wanna fill me in here?.
Yugi (Yami): It's all right, Joey; trust me..
Para and Dox: Hmhmhmhmhmhmhmhm....
Yugi (Yami): Finally, I play *this card*. Reborn the Monster!.
Para (think): No matter which of his monsters he revives with that card, it will do him no good! (aloud) Your plan will fail! Gate Guardian, attack the Dark Magician!!.
Yugi (Yami): You attacked without waiting to see *which* monster I resurrected from the graveyard pile-- so you couldn't know. You wasted your attack! .
Yugi (Yami): Suijin, Tidal Shield!!.
Para and Dox: What?!.
Yugi (Yami): Recognize the monster? You *should*, seeing as how it's *yours*. .
Para: He used his Reborn the Monster card to bring back our Suijin!.
Dox: Only now he's not *ours*--  he's been brought back on *their* side!.
Joey: Yeah-hah, *Yuge*! That's the *play a' the game*!.
Tristan: Whoo; that was a *close* one. .
Téa: Sure was..
Bakura (nods): Hm. Now the question is, can they follow through?.
Para: You have been lucky, little louts!.
Dox: But we promise, your luck's about to run out!.
Yugi (Yami): Fine, but in the meantime it's *Joey's* turn..
Joey: Right! (think) Okay. Yugi *started* our comeback; now I gotta keep it goin'..
Yugi (think): (sigh) That *water elemental* I revived bought us some time, but not a whole lot of it. It's going to be up to *Joey* to keep us in this duel. And I *know* he won't let us down..
Joey (think): Hmm. *Copycat*? 'Copies one card your opponent's thrown on the field'. .
Joey: Hmm? Mmm... Mm? Eheehee... aw man, I just got a killer idea!.
(The brothers look anxious.) .
Joey: Here it goes-- I'll use Copycat, and play it as Riryoku!.
Copycat 0/100/L5/dark.
Para and Dox: Wahh!.
Yugi (Yami): Huh?.
Joey: That's right-- say adios to half a' your lifepoints!.
Para: Aahhh...!.
Joey: But don't worry, they're goin' to a good cause; my Black Skull Dragon!.
Yugi (Yami): Great move, Joey!.
Joey: Eheheh...!.
Dox: Why power up your dragon? He is still forbidden to fly in the maze and therefore cannot move! If you were smart, you would've used it on that *treacherous water elemental*, because it's him I'm attacking! Thunderstroke Attack!!.
Yugi (Yami): Suijin, raise Tidal Shield, to defend!.
Para: To be honest, we knew you would defend!.
Dox: Indeed, now hit him again!.
Joey: Ugh...!.
Téa: What *happened*?.
Bakura: Suijin is only allowed to use his Tidal Defense ability once per turn. So the Paradox brothers split their attack into *two waves*. .
Para: Yugi! Did you really think that *one* elemental could stand a chance against *two*? That miscalculation will cost you the duel!.
Yugi (Yami): Hnh. I'm afraid you're mistaken. Not only did I know you *could* destroy Suijin, but I *planned that you would*..
Para: What do you mean?!.
Yugi (Yami): Anything to draw attention away from my Dark Magician. After all, if I'm to use this "Monster Replace" card with our Black Skull Dragon, I needed someone strategically-placed to switch places *with*..
Para: No! He can't!.
Dox: He played us for fools, brother! Knowing that his dragon could not move within our labyrinth, he had his Dark Magician do it *for* him!.
Yugi (Yami): *And now*-- Monster Replace! Exchange the Dark Magician with the Black Skull Dragon!.
Yugi (Yami): At first, I thought the only way to beat your Gate Guardian was piece by piece, but now, with our powered-up dragon, we can finish this with one final ferocious assault! Black Skull Dragon!!.
Yugi (Yami): Molten Fireball Attack! .
Joey: Heheh-- take *that*!.
Yugi (Yami): The duel goes to us!.
Téa: All right!!.
Tristan: They won!.
Téa: Doesn't that mean--.
Tristan: Oh yeah! Ten stars!.
Bakura: They *did it*?.
All three: They did it!!.
Joey: All full!.
Yugi (Yami): And all set to duel Pegasus..
Dox: Hahahahahaha...!.
Para: Not quite set. .
Para and Dox: Still one test yet!.
Yugi (Yami): I should've known...!.
Bakura, Téa, Tristan, Joey: Ohh...!.
- Oh!.
- Huh? What was--?!.
Kaiba: Mokuba!.
Mokuba: Huh? Ah; Seto? Seto, it's you!.
Kaiba (small smile): Yeah-- it's me..
Mokuba: Aw, Seto, (grips his locket)  I always knew that you would come rescue me. *Always*..
Kaiba: Little brother....
Mokuba: So what now? I bet you have some high-tech plan to get me outta-- ah!.
Kaiba: Stay still, kiddo..
Mokuba: Okay-- whatever you say, big brother!.
Kaiba: Just give me *one second* to pick this lock..
Pegasus: Well, well, the brothers Kaiba. Reunited at last..
Pegasus: *Bravo*, Kaiba, bravo. I knew nothing would stop you from getting here..
Kaiba: Pegasus..
Joey: Whaddaya *mean* there's another test? Yugi an' I just *beat you two in a duel*; isn't that *enough*?.
Para: Enough to win our star chips, but not enough to escape this labyrinth; (almost laughing) you still must choose a *door*, remember?.
Yugi (Yami): *I remember*. Now-- which of you brothers are guarding the door that leads out of here?.
Para: If you cherish your lives, you will choose *my* way..
Dox: Select my side, or else you'll pay!.
Téa: Not *this* game again! Can't you two just *act normal* and give us a straight answer for once?! .
Para and Dox: I *am* giving you a straight answer!.
Yugi (Yami): The *answer* is we can't trust *either* of these two..
Tristan: Okay guys... any bright ideas?.
Joey: Uh, sure... don't I always?.
Bakura and Téa: Mm-mmm!.
Joey (to Yugi): Ah-- *zero respect*!.
Yugi (Yami): We'll decide with *these*..
Téa, Tristan, Bakura, Joey: Ah...!.
Para and Dox: Hahahahahaha!.
Dox: Okay, heads or tails!.
Yugi (Yami): Neither. I've marked each coin to represent a different door. The coin that I keep clenched in my fist will be the door that I have chosen..
Pegasus: Ah, Kaiba. I knew you'd come for Mokuba eventually..
Kaiba: Oh, you *did*. Well tell me something, Pegasus, did you also foresee what I'm about to do to you for harming my little brother?.
Pegasus: Actually, Kaiba, I predict you won't lay a *finger* on me..
Kaiba: And why is that?.
Pegasus: Hahahahahaha...mmm..
Yugi (Yami): Ready?.
Para: That coin is marked for Dox's door--.
Dox: But was your choice good, or was it poor?.
Para: What say *you*, Dox? Should we tell which was right?.
Dox: In due time, Para; I'm enjoying their plight..
Joey: C'mon-- was it Para?.
Téa: Or was it Dox?.
Tristan: Yeah, 'fess up!.
Para and Dox: Hmhmhmhmhmhmhmhm!.
Para: I *say*--.
Dox: You choose wrong! It was *my* doorway--.
Para: All along!.
Para and Dox: Hahahahahahahahaha!.
Téa: So *Dox's* door was the right one?.
Yugi (Yami): Not quite..
Dox: Ah!.
Para: Huh? Oh yes it was!.
Yugi (Yami): Except if we *had* picked it, *Para's* door would be the right one!.
Yugi (Yami): You can change which door leads to which path, can't you? *Ensuring* that we'd choose wrong!.
Joey: That's no fair! You guys cheated!.
Dox: Too bad, too late, you chose a way! And that means--.
Para: In this maze you will stay!.
Yugi (Yami): Well, *actually*... you never *saw* our choice..
Joey: The Dox coin!.
(Everyone else is shocked.) .
Yugi (Yami): I *figured* the two of you would pull a stunt like this, so I pulled a stunt of my own with these two coins. Instead of marking them both with just *one* door insignia, I marked the second coin with *two*--.
Yugi (Yami): One insignia on each side. That way, we couldn't lose..
Joey: Ha! Beat ya at your own game!.
Yugi (Yami): *Both* of them. Now if you'll excuse us, we have a score to settle with your boss!.
Joey: Alright, then-- on to Pegasus' castle!.
Kaiba: You conniving snake! I should take you down *right now* for what you've done to Mokuba!.
Pegasus: Don't be *ridiculous*, Kaiba-boy. In my dungeon, in my *castle*, in my realm, the only one who makes *threats*... is *me*..
Kaiba: Ugghhh...!.
Mokuba: Aaaaahhhh!.
Kaiba: Mokuba..
Pegasus: Hmhmhmhmhmhmhm!.
(Pegasus holds up a card with a gold base, like a monster card; the card picture shimmers, then Mokuba appears, hands upraised as though the surface of the card is a glass wall, mouth open as though to cry out. Behind him is a dark void.) .
Kaiba: You monster! What've you done, what've you done to him?!.
Pegasus: It's just a little magic trick..
Kaiba: *Tell me*. *What have you done*?.
Pegasus: I've ensured your cooperation, for you see... Mokuba's soul is now imprisoned in a place where the locks *can't* be picked. .
Kaiba: You're mad!.
Pegasus: And there he will *remain*, Kaiba-boy, until you beat me in a duel..
Kaiba: Duel? With you? Now? Fine; I'll do anything!.
Pegasus (shakes his head): Mm-mm. Not just yet, Kaiba, you must first *earn* the privilege to challenge me. And you can only do that by defeating Yugi in a duel!.
Pegasus: And if you can't win against *him*, Mokuba's soul will stay mine *forever*! Hahahahahahahaha!.
Pegasus: So what will it be, Seto Kaiba? Do you care enough about your brother's life to try and save his soul? .
Pegasus: Not that you really have a choice; Mokuba's soul belongs to *me*..
Pegasus: *So lifelike*. But-- you probably preferred him in the *flesh*, didn't you?.
Kaiba: Rrrgghhh, you're not... *human*...!.
Pegasus: *Quite* human, actually, just extraordinarily *gifted*. Here--.
Pegasus: You'll need these for your duel with Yugi..
Kaiba: Huh? (to Pegasus) Why are you doing this?.
Pegasus: My reasons are none of your concern. .
Pegasus: Maybe I just enjoy the struggle, watching the constant *tug-of-war* between you and Yugi-boy. .
Pegasus: Or maybe I want something you're incapable of comprehending; something you'll end up delivering to me, *all tied up in a bow.*.
Kaiba: Talk straight!! Whaddaya want?!.
Pegasus: 'Want'? I want to see if you're capable of defeating little Yugi in a duel.  And only if you successfully crush him in a humiliating defeat will you get the *opportunity* to duel *me*. *Then* if you beat me I *promise* to restore your brother's soul..
Kaiba: For now... I have no choice but to play your game. But soon--.
Kaiba: As soon as I defeat Yugi I'll be back; and you'd better make good on your promise to restore my brother-- because if you don't I'll take great pleasure in separating *your* soul from *your* body in my own way!!.
Pegasus: Hmhmhmhmhmhmhmhmhm....
Joey: We're out! Fresh air at last!.
Yugi: All right!.
Bakura: What's this?.
Bakura: My Millennium Ring is *pointing*....
Téa: There-- to Pegasus's castle..
Joey: Right where we're headin'! 'Cause Yugi an' I *both* have enough chips to get us into the castle now-- isn't that right, Yuge?.
Yugi: Yeah..
Téa: *Finally*!.
Téa (think): It *all paid off* for Yugi. Sometimes he seems so *gentle*; you wouldn't think he could even *challenge* another duelist..
Téa (think, VO): But when *he duels*, it seems like he's someone *else.*.
Téa (think): Someone more *confident and determined* than the Yugi *I* know. It's almost like there are *two* Yugis..
(Téa considers the two faces of Yugi; her wide-eyed friend, and the bold and confident duelist.) .
Téa (think): Our friend whom we've known for years, and a more mysterious guy who shows up only when Yugi's in over his head. Wait-- maybe there *are* two Yugis!!.
Téa (think, VO): I *remember* now! There was a game, in the shadow realm! And there was a bigger, more serious Yugi *playing*, but *little* Yugi was *in* the game with the *rest* of us!.
FlashBack Yugi/Dark Magician: Huh?.
FlashBack Yami: Listen closely, Yugi-- use the power of the Dark Magician! Send him to the graveyard! Now!.
FlashBack Yugi/Dark Magician: You got it. Dark Magic Attack!.
Téa (think): It was like the more *experienced* Yugi, was *coaching* *our* Yugi!.
Yugi: Something wrong?.
Téa: (shakes her head) Mm-mm. I just wondered, do you ever feel like....
Joey (calls): Hey, you two! *What's the holdup?*.
Tristan: Hurry up, or we'll go inside without ya..
Bakura: You know, since none of us are even supposed to *be* here, maybe *we* should wait for *him*!.
Tristan: Heh, good point....
Yugi: Grandpa, here I come!.
Yugi: Oof!  Uugghhh....
Téa: Ouch. Uh, *this* is how you're gonna rescue your grandpa?.
Yugi: I rescued *you*. Remember?.
Téa: Mm..
Téa (think, VO): That's right; he did! And back then, I barely even *knew* him..
FlashBack Téa: Welcome to Burgerpalooza!.
FlashBack Yugi and Joey: Huh?.
FlashBack Téa: *Come right in* for the juiciest--.
FlashBack Yugi and Joey: *Téa*?!.
FlashBack Téa: Uh, Joey, Yugi!.
FlashBack Téa (think): What're they doing here?! They could get me in big trouble! You're supposed to be *eighteen* to work here; if they let it slip that I'm still in school-- I'll be *fired*!! I won't be able to pay for my dance lessons!.
FlashBack Joey: Ya know Yuge, I'm tellin' ya, we should really try to get to know Téa better. I mean she seems really nice!.
FlashBack Yugi: I know, she's very kind and she hardly ever loses her temp--.
FlashBack Téa: Ugh! *What* are you guys doing here? Are you *trying* to get me fired? Thanks a *lot*! Here, have some ketchup!.
FlashBack Joey: Ugghhh....
FlashBack Yugi: Sorry; we didn't even know you worked here..
FlashBack Joey: Ya got a lotta *attitude* for someone waitin' tables..
FlashBack Téa: You think this is all I wanna *do* with my life? .
FlashBack Joey (blankly): Huh?.
FlashBack Téa: Just wait'll I *graduate*! *Then* you know what I wanna do? Study ballet!.
FlashBack Yugi and Joey: Uh....
FlashBack Joey: Park cars, huh?.
FlashBack Téa: Not *valet*! ... *Ballet*. .
FlashBack Téa: I'm-- *saving up to go study dance, in New York!*.
FlashBack Téa: Huh? You're not laughing..
FlashBack Joey: Nah, why would we laugh, Téa?.
FlashBack Joey: You oughta be whatcha *wanna* be..
FlashBack Yugi: Yeah, that's right; follow your dreams..
Téa (think, VO): What you said that day, really made me appreciate you guys..
Téa (VO): That, and, what you did *next*..
FlashBack Téa: Huh? Oh..
FlashBack Yugi (VO): Téa-- we found a space in the old warehouse on Spring Street that you could use for a dance studio. Meet us there after school..
FlashBack Téa: A dance studio!.
Téa (VO): I couldn't wait to check it out..
FlashBack Téa: Yugi! Joey! Are you guys here?.
FlashBack Téa: *I'm warning you*-- if this is a *joke*....
FlashBack Téa: Huh? .
FlashBack Thug: Jus' hand over all the money ya got in yer purse, lady, and nobody'll get hurt!.
FlashBack Thug: Whatsa matter, lady, you heard me; gimme all a' your dough, an' make it *quick*!.
FlashBack Yugi: Téa!!!.
FlashBack Yugi: Get *away* from her!!.
FlashBack Thug: Get lost!.
FlashBack Téa: Yugi!!.
FlashBack Thug: Ugh, get off!.
FlashBack Yugi/Yami: Yu-Gi-Oh...!!.
FlashBack Yami: Turn and face me, coward! Let's see how bold you are when someone stands up to you..
FlashBack Thug: Wha?.
FlashBack Yami: Come play a little game with me, now-- and you will learn your fate..
FlashBack Thug (stands): Are you *crazy*?.
FlashBack Yami: It's a game I think even *you* could understand. We each draw a single card, and the weakest card loses. If you win, you go free-- but if you lose, *I* will decide your fate..
FlashBack Thug: Hah-- you *are* nuts!.
FlashBack Yami: So? Are you *afraid*, then?.
FlashBack Thug: Afraid! Hnh!.
(He pulls a card from the offered deck, then looks at it.) .
FlashBack Thug: Hahahaha-- let's see ya beat this card! Its points are really high!.
Curse of Dragon 2000/1500/L5/dark.
FlashBack Yami: And I drew, the Dark Magician..
Dark Magician 2500/2000/L7/dark.
FlashBack Yami: So I win!.
FlashBack Thug: Hahahaha! Enough a' your crazy game! Time to teach you a lesson, you nut job!.
FlashBack Yami: I don't think so. *Mind Crush*!!!.
FlashBack Yami: Téa? Téa..
FlashBack Yami: Are you all right? You won't have to worry about *him* anymore..
Yugi (VO): Téa?.
Yugi: Téa. I asked you if you remembered..
Téa: Yugi, I remember. But what was it that you *did* to that guy that day?.
Yugi: *I* don't know..
Yugi: When I came to, that mugger was *already* on the ground. I don't remember anything *about* it..
Téa: You're a mysterious guy, Yugi. D'you ever feel there's something *weird* going on? Sometimes you seem like you're a completely different *person*. Does what I'm saying make *any sense* to you? .
Yugi: Mm... I know what you mean. Sometimes I feel like there's someone else inside of me. I hope I'm not *losing it*....
Téa: Huh?.
Téa: Well-- whatever's going on with you, *both* of you are *really good guys*. *Trust me*..
Yugi: Hm. Thanks, Téa..
Joey (calls): 'Ey-- do we need to *carry* you guys up?!.
Tristan (calls): Yeah, what's the problem, come on!.
Téa: Come on-- let's go..
Yugi: Hm, yeah!.
Joey: You'd think someone as rich as Pegasus would put in an elevator!.
Tristan: Hey, guys, *look*-- you're not gonna *believe* who's blocking our way into the castle!.
Yugi: It's *Kaiba*!.
Joey: The heck's *he* doin' here?.
Kaiba: I can't let you pass, Yugi. .
Yugi: I've *won ten star chips*; so stand aside..
Kaiba: You may've won enough star chips to qualify for the Duelist Kingdom playoffs, Yugi; but I can't allow you to face Pegasus. He's *mine*. You and I are going to have one final duel; you will lose, and I will win. The winds of change are blowing, Yugi Muto!.
Téa: Ugh! He's so *smug* up there!.
Kaiba (think): Pegasus might be forcing me to fight Yugi, but it's a rematch I've wanted all along..
Yugi: *Step aside*, Kaiba..
Kaiba: Not until you agree to duel me!.
Yugi: I'm not *dueling* you; I don't have to!.
Kaiba: *So*. No longer confident your so-called *Heart of the Cards* can help you win? Or are you afraid you can't beat me without Exodia? *That's it*, isn't it, Yugi; you're just afraid you can't beat me a second time. You *coward*!.
Téa: You back off! He doesn't have to prove *anything*!.
Joey: Ugghh, you wanna *duel*, smart-mouth? I'll take ya, come on, let's duel!.
Kaiba: Hmhmhmhm..
Joey: Don't laugh!!.
Joey: Rrrr-rrgh!.
Tristan: Joey-- down, boy!.
Bakura: Don't forget, when you battled him before, he *slaughtered* you!.
Téa (sarcastically): Like you could do *any better*?.
Kaiba: Ha! I can't believe the little barking chihuahua already has ten star chips! You earn them yourself, or did *Yugi* throw you a few bones? .
Joey: Rrrrggghhhh, don't call me a, *chihuahua*, rrrggghhhh....
Kaiba: Heheheh, don't let 'im snap his chain. There's no challenge in humiliating *you* again, Joey; there's only one player who's ever beaten me at Duel Monsters, and that's Yugi..
Kaiba (VO): But *how* he did it is a mystery that still eats away at me! I was *winning* our battle; my Blue-Eyes White Dragon was devastating his forces..
Kaiba (VO): His monsters couldn't stand up to its withering attacks. And then I drew my *second* Blue-Eyes!.
Kaiba (VO): I was invincible! Yugi thought the attack strength of his Dark Magician could stop me..
Kaiba (VO): But he never dreamed I'd draw my *third* Blue-Eyes, which blew his Magician away, obliterating his lifepoints!.
Kaiba (VO): But *then*....
FlashBack Yugi (Yami): And now I'll play, the unstoppable Exodia!.
Kaiba (VO): Just as he was on the verge of defeat, Yugi somehow achieved the unachievable!.
(Through one of the star's points emerges an arm, then another through the opposite point, then Exodia's head appears in the middle of the star as the great behemoth pulls itself from its prison and faces the three Blue-Eyes White Dragons, which are now looking decisively smaller.) .
Kaiba (VO): He assembled all five pieces of Exodia!.
FlashBack Kaiba: Exodia! Aah, it's not possible!! No one's *ever* been able to call *him*!.
Kaiba (VO): But somehow, he *had*!!.
FlashBack Kaiba: Aaaaaaaahhhhhhhh!!!.
Kaiba: Yugi... you said you won by tapping into the Heart of the Cards, and for a long time I didn't know what that meant. But now, I think I *do*. And it took *Pegasus* to show me..
Kaiba: He gave me a reason to put my heart in the cards..
Mokuba (VO): Help me, big brother!.
Kaiba (think): I *will* help you, Mokuba! There's not a power on Earth that will stop me-- not Pegasus, not Yugi! (aloud) For the first time, Yugi, I can duel with fire and passion in my heart!.
Yugi: I can feel it! (think) Kaiba *has* changed; I can sense it. He's fighting for more than just himself this time. There's a new belief, in the Heart of the Cards!.
Bakura: Yugi-- you can't accept this duel! .
Téa: You've already earned enough star chips to get into the castle..
Kaiba: I've changed; I deserve a rematch. Give me a chance to play you now, Yugi-- let me play you for the *right* reasons..
Yugi (think): After all grandpa's taught me, how can I deny the Heart of the Cards?.
FlashBack Yugi/Yami: Yu-Gi-Oh...!!.
Yugi (Yami): Mmm..
Téa (think): It's *happened* again! *Yugi suddenly seems different*!.
Yugi (Yami): Kaiba-- I accept your duel; we'll see what you've *really* learned. You just name the place!.
Kaiba: Our dueling field has been prepared. Follow me..
Yugi (Yami): All right, Kaiba-- it's time to duel!.
Bandit Keith: I'm here for the duelist playoffs. I need ten star chips, right?.
Bandit Keith: Well I *got 'em*..
Kemo: You qualify. But the *real* fun's on the annex roof; ya gotta check it out!.
Bandit Keith: Some action on the *roof*, ah? Thanks, dude; maybe I *will*!.
Bandit Keith: Hahaha, wonder what's *shakin'*?.
Kaiba: Yugi-- here's the deal..
Kaiba: We'll each wager five star chips on this duel and the winner will be the only one who earns the right to enter the main castle..
Yugi (Yami): Done; five chips..
Kaiba: We'll use my duel disk system. Insert your shuffled deck into the card recognition slot. .
Kaiba: Lifepoints automatically set to two thousand..
Joey: Take 'im! Ya did it *once*, Yugi, so we know that you can do it again!.
Tristan: Yeah!.
Téa: That's right! .
Bandit Keith: Looks like it'll *take a while* for the other finalists to catch up playin' by the rules, so I might as well kill some time watchin' this duel... Huh?.
Bandit Keith: It's those punks I trapped underground! But how'd they get out? I thought I trapped 'em in that underground cave forever! Who's that...?.
Bandit Keith: Is that... *Seto Kaiba*? Heh, Kaiba's in a rematch with Yugi, this I gotta *see*! For the duel a' the century, I need a ringside seat! Heheh!.
Yugi (Yami): All right-- are you ready to duel, Kaiba?.
Kaiba: This is it, Yugi! Whoever wins, faces Pegasus! And whoever loses, well, you'll be left a broken man!.
Yugi (Yami): We'll *see* who gets broken, Kaiba! (points) I will defeat you once and for all!.
Yugi (Yami) and Kaiba: Let's duel!.
Kaiba: Stand back and prepare for battle!.
Kaiba: I play Ryu-Kishin, in attack mode!.
Téa: Look! The cards!.
Joey: They're holograms-- just like the monsters! .
Yugi (Yami): On your guard. (throw) I play Curse of Dragon, in attack mode!.
Ryu-Kishin 1600/1200//.
Curse of Dragon 2000/1500//.
Kaiba: Huh! *Well done*. A formidable card, Yugi, and a play I would expect from a duelist of your caliber..
Yugi (Yami): Don't patronize me!.
Kaiba: Yugi, I know from playing you you're a talented duelist; but you're *just* not as good as *I* am. Listen up-- only one duelist is gonna challenge Pegasus and that's *me*!.
Yugi (Yami): *Wrong*..
Kaiba: Then attack, and find out. What's the matter, Yugi, no faith in your monster?.
Yugi (Yami): You'll see-- he's mightier than yours! Go, Curse of Dragon! Attack Ryu-Kishin! Dragon Flame!!.
Yugi (Yami): There-- Ryu-Kishin is no more!.
Kaiba: Hm. You're good, but *oh* so predictable. Don't you think I *expected* that attack? And once again, you've played *right into my hands*, Yugi. .
Joey: He's bluffin'! Y'already got Kaiba on the ropes! All right, go Yugi!.
Kaiba: It's not a bluff; as you will *all* soon see. (draw) Mm... heh..
Kaiba: I play, Swordstalker!.
Swordstalker 2000///.
Kaiba: The Swordstalker gathers the life force of a fallen ally, raising his own attack power by twenty percent! Watch..
Yugi (Yami): So *that's* why Kaiba allowed his Ryu-Kishin to be defeated *so easily*! So he could use its energy to create an even *stronger monster*. And now that he's done that, his Swordstalker's attack strength, is even greater than that of my Curse of Dragon!.
Kaiba: Attack now, Swordstalker! Vengeance Strike!.
Kaiba: What?! The Curse of Dragon disappeared!.
Yugi (Yami): That's because I laid a "Monster Replace" magic card on the field. .
(One of the holographic cards facing Yugi turns around.) .
Yugi (Yami): This card switches the monster on the field with the monster in my hand that has the *highest* attack power!.
Yugi (Yami): And you know what *that* means. The creature with the greatest attack power in my hand, is the Dark Magician!.
Dark Magician 2500/2100//.
Yugi (Yami): Dark Magic Attack!.
Yugi (Yami): The Dark Magician vanquishes your Swordstalker!.
Joey: All ri-i-ight! Hehehey! Kaiba-- Yugi put the moves on you again!.
Kaiba (aside): Hmph. *Clueless*. If those fools only knew... what I have in store..
Yugi (Yami): Now I can replay-- Curse of Dragon, in attack mode!.
Curse of Dragon 2000/1500/L5/dark.
Yugi (Yami): Your move, Kaiba!.
Kaiba: I'll take on your magic, with a magician of my own! (throws disk) I summon La Jinn, the Mystical Genie!.
La Jinn the Mystical Genie of the Lamp 1800/1000//.
La Jinn: Hmhmhm!.
Kaiba: My wish is his command!.
Yugi (Yami): Dark Magician-- attack La Jinn!  Dark Magic Attack!.
Kaiba: Your attack activates my trap! The "Ancient Lamp"! First it protects my Genie by drawing him into the lamp..
Yugi (Yami): What?.
Kaiba: Then the lamp deflects your attack, turning it back on your monster!.
Kaiba: Which lowers your score to equal mine!.
Yugi (Yami): Rrggh!.
Kaiba: Reflect upon the incredible defensive powers of my Ancient Lamp!.
Yugi (Yami): My deflected attack *may* have destroyed Curse of Dragon, but I still have the Dark Magician!.
Yugi (Yami): Kaiba-- for all your bragging, the score is tied. We're evenly matched..
Kaiba (think): Hmph! Yugi doesn't suspect that so far my maneuvers, clever as they are, are all just ploys to distract him from my *real* plan-- to assemble all three Blue-Eyes in my deck, to create a monster more powerful than any he's ever seen! .
Kaiba (think): For combined, they create the ultimate creature of destruction! The Blue-Eyes Ultimate Dragon!.
